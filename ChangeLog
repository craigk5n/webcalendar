Version 0.9.30dev (?? Jun 01)

    and year view when viewing another user's calendar.

    on Postgres.

Version 0.9.28 (01 Jun 01)
  - Moved all the references to the webcal_user table to be in the
    new includes/user.inc file.  This BREAKS the NIS user authentication,
    but it should make adding LDAP (or any other user table) support
    much simpler.

    decide whether they want to receive email for event reminders,
    new events, updated events, deleted events, and rejected events.

  - Added support for customizing event fields.  This allows each
    site to add textual fields, dates, URLs, etc. without having
    to customize their database or make code changes.
    All customization takes place in includes/site_extras.inc.
    These changes include two new database tables that must
    be created.  See UPGRADING.
  - Added support for email reminders.  This is handled by
    the custom field events (see includes/site_extras.inc).
    Requires cron or cron-like tool.
  - Support W3C standards for use with the event popup windows
    which should work with Mozilla, Netscape 6.X and MSIE 5.X.
    Code submitted by Benoit Maisonny.
  - Restored support for PHP3 that was broken with the addition of
    the call to array_splice (a PHP4-only function).  There is
    now a PHP3-compatible implementation.

    after the delete.

      not quite complete because it doesn't support recurrence yet.
      Also added a checkbox for exporting all the user's events

      to allow them to be parsed out by a script or Palm conduit.

  - Fixed bug: when week starts on Monday, week view displayed first

    a direct link to accept or reject the event.  (You are no longer
    required to view the event before accepting/rejecting.)

  - Changed styles.css to be a PHP include (styles.inc) so some of it
    can be generated dynamically (eventually)
