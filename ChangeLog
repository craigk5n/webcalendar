 turn this feature on. For security reason, the DEFAULT will be
 to always say Invalid login.

 - Added support for all-day events that will prevent any events from

 admin user's approval.)

 allow you to delete repeating event for just one day, delete
 for all days, edit for just one day, edit for all days. After
 adding an exception event, if the original repeating event is deleted,
 the exception event will also be deleted.
 - When deleting an event, just set the status in webcal_entry_user to
 'D' rather than deleting all the information from the database.
 So, users will still be able to view deleted events.
 - When viewing an event, display the status (right under description)
 if the status is anything but approved. (So, it will show up if
 either Waiting on approval, Rejected, or Deleted.)
 - Converted README to README.html.
 - When viewing a repeating event, show the date the user selected
 to view (instead of the first date of the event) along with the
 repeating info.
 - Display view name under the date at the top of the page.
 - Fixed send_reminders.php to not send a reminder to users who
 rejected the event.
 - Modified webcal_entry_log activity log table by adding new cal_user_cal
 column. One column for user performing action, another column
 (cal_user_cal) for who's calendar it affects.
 - Updated edit event handler to make sure user has proper authority
 to update an event. (Prevent users from typing in a URL to make
 changes to an event.)
 - Added Activity Log page (accessible only by administrators) that
 shows recent activity for all events.
 - Updated French translation
 - Updated German translation
Version 0.9.36 (20 Jun 2002)

 - Added create table SQL in tables-postgres.sql and tables-oracle.sql
 for webcal_config table.
 - Added user-nis.php for NIS-based authentication
 - Reorganized the English-US.txt translation file. All text is grouped
 by the page that it appears on. Added new perl script in the tools
 directory called pagify_translation.pl that will take an existing
 translation and reorganize it in this way. Hopefully, this will make
 translations a little easier since you can now determine the context
 of the text.
 - Improved session security by including a portion of the user's
 encrypted password in the cookie.
 - Fixed Bug 568261: Fixed send_reminders.php script which had been set to
 test-mode and was not sending mail.

 - Added mailto links on view event page and Email all participants
 link at the bottom.

Version 0.9.35 (05 Jun 2002)
 - Added fancy new admin interface for setting WebCalendar settings.
 Almost all settings previously found in config.inc are now set
 through the new admin interface.
 - Allow user to customize application title (appears in page titlebar
 and login page).
 - Added event URL to email notifications.
 - Added ability to specify main URL for WebCalendar (included in
 email reminders and notifications) from within the new admin interface.
 DEFAULT value for server location will be calculated but can be
 modified.
 - Removed Browser-defined as a language option for users in the
 preference settings page. Users must select a language.
 Additionally, if the user has not made a language setting and one
 can be determined from their browser settings, then the language
 setting will be saved in the database (so that it can be used when
 sending email reminders).
 - Added ability to customize the DEFAULT text color (for users that
 prefer to set their background to black).
 - Added support for user views (month and week) that allow users
 to create a custom view of specific users and view their calendars
 side by side. Views are unique to each user so that if user A
 creates a view, then user B will not be able to see the view.
 - Added support for mouse-over tooltips using style sheets. Unfortunately,
 only MSIE supports this, but it's a cool feature. Currently supported
 on the admin settings, preferences, and add/edit event pages.
 - Added the long-asked-for group support. Users can belong to more than
 one group (or none). The calendar can be configured to allow users
 to access all groups and users or it can be setup so that (non-admin)
 users only see groups that they are members of and users that are in
 those groups (see config.php).
 - Added support for public access to the calendar that requires no
 login. Works with web-based login and HTTP-based login. However,
 HTTP-based authentication setup is more complicated (see FAQ).
 - Renamed all include files from .inc to .php. This will help avoid
 security holes if users don't turn off browsing in the includes
 directory.
 - Improved security of edit_user_handler.php to prevent knowledgeable
 users from typing in a URL to make user updates that cannot be made
 from the web interface.
 - Display URL of event when sending out an email notification. (Not
 yet implemented for reminders.)
 - Patch 548138: Added Interbase support

 (layers.php).
 - Fixed missing password on PostgreSQL login in php-dbi.php.
 - Some URLs in description were not being linked properly.
 - Fixed fonts in week view to be consistent size.
 - Layers now display in new color (defined in styles.php) and are
 no longer underlined.
 - If $ALLOW_COLOR_CUSTOMIZATION was set to false in config.php, users
 were getting an error on saving preferences.
 - Check user preferences for receiving reminders before sending one.
 - Updated send_reminders.php to be LDAP-aware. Now uses same user
 functions as rest of the system.
 - Updated send_reminders.php to check language preference for each user.
 If user has set a language preference, reminders will come in that
 language. (Language will be auto-set in the system the first time
 they access the calendar with a browser.)
 - Modified printer-friendly pages to use a single table with a visible
 border for better printing.
 - Enhanced search page to allow searching of other user's calendars
 if allowed by system settings.
 - Fixed bug 530015: allow duration hours and minutes to be more than
 two characters long.
 - Don't allow a user to create a layer using their login as the source.
 - Feature request 529453: show user's fullname rather than login in
 the popup for an event of another user showing up in a layer.
 - Modified all calls to mktime() to use 2AM instead of midnight in
 hopes of squashing all daylight-savings-related bugs.
 - Fixed bug 449084: Don't allow users to enter a time of 24:00 for an
 event (when using 24-hour time format).
 - Fixed bug 491615: Preserve new lines in description when displaying
 in event popup.
 - Added activity log for events that is available to administrators.
 Tracks event creation, update, accept, reject, notification and
 reminders.
 - Updated FAQ and converted it to HTML.
Version 0.9.34 (16 Dec 2001)

 confidential)
 - Patch 469755: Do not allow users to change preferences in a read-only
 setup
 - Fixed bug: layers would not work until a user turns them off and then
 back on.
 - Display users in a table on page to select other user's calendar for
 better display (if more than 20 users).
 - Patch 483782: Delete users even if they have events and delete those
 events.
 - MS IIS/PSW workaround: IIS does not allow you to send a cookie and
 a redirect in the same http header, so all redirects are handled
 using html meta tags when IIS is detected.
 Code submitted by Nick Temple <ntemple@teentriumph.org>.
 - Fixed bug 447339: In week view, events would not span enough hours
 in the display if there was another event later in that day. In
 day view, all events would display in a one hour block even if they
 were longer than an hour.
 - Added Galician translation.
 - Added Hungarian translation.
 - Updated Swedish translation.
 - Updated French translation.
Version 0.9.33 (02 Aug 01)
 - Fixed bug: the back to my calendar link would go to another user's
 calendar if you just viewed another user's calendar.
 - Fixed bug: was not displaying more than one event per day in the
 week view.
 - Removed all the <?php_track_vars?> from every .php file since it was
 causing problems for a lot of people.
 - Fixed bug: User who logged in to the 0.9.31 version would have a
 session cookie that would generate a Error getting user message.
 Now redirects them back to the login page.
 - Fixed bug: don't display access, priority and participants in email
 reminders if they've been disabled in config.inc
 - Added missing user-ldap.inc to the distribution.
 - Updated Swedish translation
Version 0.9.32 (26 July 01)
 - Fixed some of the login/session code. After examining the code, I'm
 surprised it worked at all! :-) And, it suddenly stopped working on
 my system (would not allow any logins), so it could very will have
 been the bug that prevented people from being able to login.
 - Fixed bug: Was not allowing admin users to add events to a read-only
 setup.
 - Attempted to not reference undefined variables to avoid the warnings
 generated by PHP when the warning level is set to complain about
 referencing undefined variables.
 - Fixed bug: Was not allowing selection of a user when adding/editing
 layers.
 - Fixed bug: If you set a reminder to be sent at the exact time
 of the event (0 days, hours, minutes before event), then when
 you come back to edit the event, it shows the DEFAULT time before
 rather than 0.
 - Fixed bug: printer friendly version of week view was displaying
 events as links.
 - Fixed use of php_track_vars. Was using <?php php_track_vars?>.
 Proper use is just <?php_track_vars?>.
 - Fixed bug 441688: MySQL does case-insensitive searches, which allows
 a user named 'cknudsen' to login with 'CKnudsen', which causes
 problems. Now, users can only login with correct case-sensitive
 login.
 - Fixed bug: when view a non-repeating event, some of the
 text for repeating events (every) would be displayed next
 to the event date.
 - Remember the last view (week, day or month) and return to it
 instead of returning to the preferred view. For example, if
 you were viewing March 2002, then viewed an event in that
 month, and then deleted it, you would be returned to the
 March 2002 view after the delete. (Uses cookies to do this.)
 - Fixes to php-dbi.inc for postgres and odbc issues. May break
 compatibility with early versions of PHP 3.0 and PHP 4.0
 - Updated INSTALL and FAQ files.
 - Initial LDAP support.
 - Security improvement: Use $single_user boolean rather than using
 strlen ( $single_user_login )
 - Fixed bug 438980: Oracle SQL syntax error in tables-oracle.sql
 - Fixed bug: When participant list display is disabled, events
 were not being created properly.
Version 0.9.31 (02 Jul 01)
 - Added Swedish translation.
 - Updated Dutch translation.
 - Added ability to disable some of the standard event fields (access,
 priority, participants, repeating) to simplify interface for some
 users. Set in includes/config.inc with $DISABLE_PRIORITY_FIELD,
 $DISABLE_ACCESS_FIELD, $DISABLE_PARTICIPANTS_FIELD, and
 $DISABLE_REPEATING_FIELD.
 - Can now specify $ALLOW_VIEW_OTHER to be false in includes/config.inc
 to prevent users from viewing other users' calendars. (Admin users
 will still be able to do this.) The combination of this and setting
 $DISABLE_PARTICIPANTS_FIELD = true will give non-admin users the
 feel of a single-user calendar. (Note: Setting $ALLOW_VIEW_OTHER
 to false will also disable layers since that is essentially viewing
 another user's calendar.)
 - Added $conflict_repeat_months to includes/config.inc. This defines
 how many months into the future we should check for conflicts when
 saving a repeating event. On a slow server, the DEFAULT (6 months)
 may take too long.
 - Fixed bug 436330: Oracle complaining about too many open cursors.
 Added some missing dbi_free_result() calls to address this.
 - Fixed bug 436404: Error in conflict checking - was always replacing
 first event participant with event creator when checking for
 conflicts.
 - Feature request 423034: On the event view page, any URLs found
 in the description field will be turned into an HTML link for
 you. Don't enter HTML in the description, just enter the URL
 somewhere in the description.
 - Feature request 432334: Display week number in week view.
 - Updated French translation to use HTML escapes for non-standard
 characters.
 - Patch 435431 from Franz Sedlmaier:
 Display repeating event information on event view page.
 - Patch 435403 from Franz Sedlmaier:
 When a user edits an event, save the existing status (accepted,
 rejected) of each user rather than resetting it back to
 pending. Don't send users notifications unless the date/time changed.
 - Patch 435396 from Franz Sedlmaier for bug 435390:
 Notification for rejecting events was not working. Don't send
 the notification to other users who rejected the event.
 - Patch 435387 from Franz Sedlmaier for bug 435386:
 Fix HTML errors in preferences page. Fix error that caused
 Oracle to complain about NULL values.
 - Patch 435383 from Franz Sedlmaier for bug 435379:
 Notification for deleting events was not working. Don't send
 the notification to the person deleting the event.
 - Patch 435367 from Franz Sedlmaier:
 Allow user to override warning about conflicting events and save
 event anyway.
 - Fixed bug 214280: sometimes events would display shifted one day to
 right on week view.
 - Fixed bug 212550: unable to display short month name for May in
 languages where short name and long name are different.
 - Fixed bug 215549: if calendar is read-only, don't show new image,
 and don't allow users to add events.
 - Fixed bug 214381: don't try and use translate() in http header
 for sending http authorization request if translations have not
 yet been loaded.
 - Don't allow user to change password if using http authorization.
 - Added back selectDate javascript function that was mistakenly
 removed from edit_entry.php.

 on Postgres.
 - Fixed bug: conflict checking was not working properly for repeating
 events when future dates were in a different daylight savings mode.
Version 0.9.29 (05 Jun 01)
 - Fixed bug: When editing an event, the event date is set to the
 current date rather than the event's date.
 - Fixed bug: Adding missing argument to $WC->User->loadVariables() in
 login.php that was preventing some people from being able to login.
Version 0.9.28 (01 Jun 01)
 - Moved all the references to the webcal_user table to be in the
 new includes/user.inc file. This BREAKS the NIS user authentication,
 but it should make adding LDAP (or any other user table) support
 much simpler.
 - Added preference settings for receiving email. Users can now
 decide whether they want to receive email for event reminders,
 new events, updated events, deleted events, and rejected events.
 - Fixed bug 429264: The $is_admin variable was not being set properly,
 so no users were able to access admin functions.

 reminders.
 - Fixed bug 429271: error message on missing argument to my_array_slice().
 - Security fixes
 - Updated translations: French
Version 0.9.27 (20 May 01)
 - Added support for customizing event fields. This allows each
 site to add textual fields, dates, URLs, etc. without having
 to customize their database or make code changes.
 All customization takes place in includes/site_extras.inc.
 These changes include two new database tables that must
 be created. See UPGRADING.
 - Added support for email reminders. This is handled by
 the custom field events (see includes/site_extras.inc).
 Requires cron or cron-like tool.
 - Support W3C standards for use with the event popup windows
 which should work with Mozilla, Netscape 6.X and MSIE 5.X.
 Code submitted by Benoit Maisonny.
 - Restored support for PHP3 that was broken with the addition of
 the call to array_splice (a PHP4-only function). There is
 now a PHP3-compatible implementation.
 - Patch 403822 from David Guthrie:

 - allow 15:00 am to be recognized as 3:00 pm
