Possible enhancements to add for 0.9.46:

Com
ple     Description
te?
--- -------------------------------------

[ ] PHP4 sessions instead of my cookie code
    (which may be behind some of the login problems)
[ ] User self-registration with optional email and/or admin validation
[ ] Better handling of large numbers of users (1000+).
    We have one user who claims the JS chokes the browser with 1000+
    users when you press the "Select..." button
[ ] Web-based MySQL database install/upgrade.
    I still don't think this is possible with non-mysql databases,
    but I could be wrong...  This would add on to the existing
    db config web page.
[ ] Add UI for adding category icons
[ ] Add support for category colors
[ ] Setup wizard (web-based) that would guide the admin through setting
    up what is now in System Settings and explain why they would want
    to use any particular option.
    It could start with primary use (Home Single User, Small Biz,
    Large Enterprise, Events Calendar, etc...)
    (Unfortunately, this will add a lot of text which will require
    translations and would make the WebCalendar download much larger.
    The translations account for about 40% of the size of the current download.)
[ ] Improve the popup code.
    (I do like the Knoppix code and it is also GPL, so that would be
    a good place to start)
[ ] Add email notification for submission of new public events
    (ideally, multiple email recipients will be possible)
[ ] Better user sorting.  Perhaps create new db fields in webcal_user
    (lastname, firstname).  Admin could then select sort priority
    (login or lastname).
[ ] Theme or color scheme selection.
    We would pre-populate some good color schemes.

Here are some other ideas for the next or perhaps later releases:
[ ] Admin diagnostics page that could:
  + tell user where php.ini is :-)
  + send a test mail message
  + help debug login problems
  + help debug send reminder problem
[ ] "Real" ACL with new security/access API.
    Each page would just call a function and pass in the current user
    and the request, and the API would either grant or deny access.
[ ] Ability to support a reservation system (for either a single resource
    or multiple resources) as the primary use
[ ] Add a mini-cal iframe using the new mini-cal code
    (but it should include event popups)
[ ] Java-based tool (web start) for monitoring and approving new
    public events (would run in background until new event is submitted,
    then popup for accept/reject)
[ ] Admin tool for importing a large number of users (CSV, tab-delimeted, etc.)
[ ] Support for remote calendar subscriptions (ical) for each user.
    Would need to add a new cron job to periodically update/re-import
    the remote ics file.
[ ] Add iCal client publish so Mozilla Calendar (or Apple iCal) can
    create events and publish back to WebCalendar.
    (This has a very high cool factor.)
