FAQs:

Q: How do I get the latest development version of WebCalendar?
A: The latest code snapshot is always available through CVS on
   SourceForge.  If you're not comfortable with CVS, then stick to
   public releases.  In order to get the files from CVS, use the
   following command to login to CVS for the first time:

     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.webcalendar.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webcalendar login

   (If you get a connection refused error, make sure you set your
   CVS_RSH environment variable to ssh.)
   Then, to get the files for the first time, use the following command:

     cvs -z8 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.webcalendar.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/webcalendar co webcalendar

   This should create a new webcalendar directory in the current directory.
   After you've done this, you can get the latest code with:

     cvs update

   You can find these instructions online at:
     http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3870

Q: How do I get more info on CVS?
A: You can start at the SourceForge CVS HOWTO:
     http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=763&group_id=1

Q: When I try to login, I get sent back to the login page with no error.
A: Make sure that you built PHP with --enable-track-vars during the
   configure step.  Make sure your browser has cookies enabled.  Either
   of these can cause this problem.

Q: Does WebCalendar work under Windows?
A: I've received confirmation of someone using WebCalendar using
   MS Access with ODBC and another using Oracle.  It should be
   simple to setup under Windows.  You will, however, need to find
   a cron-like application to run your send_reminders.php script
   periodically.

   If you don't have PHP setup yet on your Windows machine, you
   may want to take a look at PHPTriad.  This nifty tool installs
   a PHP server environment (PHP, MySQL, and Apache) on Windows
   for you.  The URL is:
     http://www.phpgeek.com/phptriad.php

Q: Does it work with PHP 4?
A: Yep.

Q: Does it work with PHP 3?
A: Yep.

Q: How do I install Apache with PHP and MySQL?
A: There are many online guides to doing this, including the following
   page at Linux Journal:
     http://www2.linuxjournal.com/articles/linux_review/0024.html

Q: Why do quotations not enter into the database properly?
A: The system is designed to work with PHP's magic quotes feature
   that automatically adds backslashes for you.  (This is configurable
   in php.ini.)

Q: I'd like to translate WebCalendar into another language.  What do I do?
A: It's a fairly simple process.  If you've ever translated a C-based app
   that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem.  The I18N
   support was based on GNU's gettext.  Here's what you need to do.
   - look in the "translations" directory
   - copy the "English-US.txt" file into what you'd like to call your
     language data file.  (e.g. "cp English-US.txt French.txt")
   - Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ":" into the
     new language.  Do _not_ alter the text to the left of the ":".
   - When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
     Run the check_translation.pl script on your new data file to make
     sure you have all the needed translations.
     (e.g. "./check_translation.pl ../translations/French.txt")
   - Add the new language to both the $languages array and the
     $browser_languages arrays defined in includes/config.inc.
   - Test it out...
   - Email a copy of the new .txt data file to cknudsen@radix.net.

Q: I get an error about binhex() being an unsupported function.  What
   does that mean?
A: The binhex() function was not in the early PHP 3.0.X releases.  You
   need to upgrade to a more recent PHP3 (or use PHP4).

Q: Why aren't you using PHP4 sessions or PHPLIB sessions?
A: It would really be overkill for what the application needs.  It also
   simplifies installation by not requiring PHPLIB or PHP4.  A future
   version might switch to PHP4 sessions as PHP4 becomes more common.

Q: Why aren't you using ADODB for database access?
   Again, this would be overkill for what we need.  ADODB is almost
   as big as WebCalendar itself, so I'm partial to my leaner php-dbi.inc
   solution.

Q: Is there an online demo?
A: Yes, there is.  User "demo" for login and "demo" for password at:
   http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/
   Don't be surprised if it appears in a language other than English.
   Changing the language setting seems to be a favorite.

Q: Where do I report bugs? 
   You can report bugs on SourceForge at:
   http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=3870

Q: Where do I get help?
A: Try the Forums on SourceForge:
   http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=3870
   Someone has even posted some links for problems setting up PHP and MySQL.

Q: What license is WebCalendar distributed under?
A: WebCalender is distrubuted under the GPL.  (See COPYING file included
   with the distribution.)
   There is a FAQ about the GPL at:
