FAQs:

Q: When I try to login, I get sent back to the login page with no error.
A: Make sure that you built PHP with --enable-track-vars during the
   configure step.  Make sure your browser has cookies enabled.  Either
   of these can cause this problem.

Q: Does WebCalendar work under Windows?
A: I've received confirmation of someone using WebCalendar using
   MS Access with ODBC and another using Oracle.  It should be
   simple to setup under Windows.  You will, however, need to find
   a cron-like application to run your send_reminders.php script
   periodically.

Q: Does it work with PHP 4?
A: Yep.

Q: Does it work with PHP 3?
A: Yep.

Q: How do I install Apache with PHP and MySQL?
A: There are many online guides to doing this, including the following
   page at Linux Journal:
     http://www2.linuxjournal.com/articles/linux_review/0024.html

Q: Why do quotations not enter into the database properly?
A: The system is designed to work with PHP's magic quotes feature
   that automatically adds backslashes for you.  (This is configurable
   in php.ini.)

Q: I'd like to translate WebCalendar into another language.  What do I do?
A: It's a fairly simple process.  If you've ever translated a C-based app
   that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem.  The I18N
   support was based on GNU's gettext.  Here's what you need to do.
   - look in the "translations" directory
   - copy the "English-US.txt" file into what you'd like to call your
     language data file.  (e.g. "cp English-US.txt French.txt")
   - Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ":" into the
     new language.  Do _not_ alter the text to the left of the ":".
   - When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
     Run the check_translation.pl script on your new data file to make
     sure you have all the needed translations.
     (e.g. "./check_translation.pl ../translations/French.txt")
   - Add the new language to both the $languages array and the
     $browser_languages arrays defined in includes/config.inc.
   - Test it out...
   - Email a copy of the new .txt data file to cknudsen@radix.net.

Q: I get an error about binhex() being an unsupported function.  What
   does that mean?
A: The binhex() function was not in the early PHP 3.0.X releases.  You
   need to upgrade to a more recent PHP3 (or use PHP4).

Q: Why aren't you using PHP4 sessions or PHPLIB sessions?
A: It would really be overkill for what the application needs.  It also
   simplifies installation by not requiring PHPLIB or PHP4.  A future
   version might switch to PHP4 sessions as PHP4 becomes more common.

Q: Why aren't you using ADODB for database access?
   Again, this would be overkill for what we need.  ADODB is almost
   as big as WebCalendar itself, so I'm partial to my leaner php-dbi.inc
   solution.

Q: Is there an online demo?
A: Yes, there is.  User "demo" for login and "demo" for password at:
   http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/
   Don't be surprised if it appears in a language other than English.
   Changing the language setting seems to be a favorite.

Q: Where do I report bugs?
