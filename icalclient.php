 *               WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING
 *                 This script is still considered alpha level.
 *                 Please backup your database before using it.
 *               WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING * WARNING
 *
 * Description:
 * Creates the iCal output for a single user's calendar so that remote users can
 * "subscribe" to a WebCalendar calendar. Both Apple iCal and Mozilla's calendar
 * (Sunbird) support subscribing to remote calendars and publishing events back
 * to the server (WebCalendar in this case).
 *
 * This file was based on publish.php
 * and may replace it when it is found to be stable.
 *
 * Note that unlike the export to iCal, this page does not include
 * attendee info. This improves the performance considerably, BTW.
 *
 * ERROR !!!!!
 * There seems to be a bug in certain versions of PHP where the fgets () returns
 * a blank string when reading stdin. I found this to be a problem with
 * PHP 4.1.2 on Linux. If this is true for your PHP, you will not be able to
 * import the events back from the ical client.
 * It did work correctly with PHP 5.0.2.
 *
 * The script sends an error message back to the iCal client,
 * but Mozilla Calendar does not seem to display the message.
 * (Strange, since it did display a PHP compile error message...)
 *
 * Usage Requirements:
 * For this work, at least on some Apache intallations,
 * the following may need to be added to the httpd.conf file:
 *  <Directory "/var/www/html/webcalendar">
 *    Script PUT /icalclient.php
 *  </Directory>
 * Of course, replace "/var/www/html/webcalendar" with the
 * directory where you installed WebCalendar.
 *
 * Input parameters:
 * None
 *
 * Security:
 * If $PUBLISH_ENABLED is not 'Y' (set in Admin System Settings), do not allow.
 * If $USER_PUBLISH_RW_ENABLED is not 'Y' (set in each user's Preferences), do not allow.
 *
 * Change List:
 * 06-Jan-2005 Ray Jones
 *   Added logic to publish calendars to remote iCal clients.
 *   The clients I've tested use METHOD:PUT to upload their data to the server.
 *   This file does not use WEBDAV, but the client doesn't know or seem to care.
 *
 * Notes:
 * Because data is being written back to WebCalendar, the user is prompted
 * for username and password via the 401 HEADER.
 * SEE TO DO for needed work.
 *
 * To Delete an event from the iCal client, mark it as 'Cancelled'.
 * This will translate into a 'D' in webcal_entry_user.cal_status.
 *
 * TODO:
 * Security!  If an event update comes back from an iCal client, we need to make
 * sure that the remote user has the authority to modify the event. (If they are
 * only a participant and not the creator of the event or an admin, then they
 * should not be able to update an event.)
 *
 * MAYBE add logic to loop through webcal_import_data and delete any records that
 * don't come back from the iCal client. This would indicate events were deleted
 * from the client instead of being marked 'Cancelled'.
 *
 * HTML in cal_description gets escaped when coming back from iCal client.
 * Some formatting is getting deleted. I added a couple lines to modify these
 * and it seems to work. However....you never know what it might break.
 *
 * Testing needs to be done with various RRULE options on import.
 *
 * Better support for event reminders. Reminders for past events are not sent
 * currently. This is because Mozilla Calendar may popup all reminders (even
 * ones that are years old) when the calendar is loaded. Ideally, we should
 * check the webcal_reminders table to see if an event reminder was already sent.
 * Also, not sure if reminders for repeated events are handled properly yet.
