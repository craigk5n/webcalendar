# Use this as a starting point to translate this application into
# another language.  The format is "English text: translated text"
# There cannot be a ":" in the English text.
# Translated by:
# your name and email here...
# Last update: 02 July 2002
# Check out the tools directory which contains two perl scripts:
#   check_translation.pl will tell you if you have successfully translated
#        all required text
#   update_translation.pl will take an old translation file and move the
#        translations around so they age grouped by the page they appear in.
#        It will also identify any missing translations and tag them
#        with a comment.  If it is a non-english translation, the english
#        translation will be included in the comment to simplify completing
#        the translation.
#
# Note: You will notice the entry for "May_" below.  There's a reason for
# this.  Translate "May_" to the full month name and "May" to the three-letter
# month abbreviation (like "Oct" for "October").
