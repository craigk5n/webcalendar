# Use this as a starting point to translate WebCalendar into other languages.
#
# Note to translators:  If you want to copy these header comments to your
# language file and translate them, too, that's OK with us.
#
# The format consists of an optional header:
#
# Translated by: your name and email
# Last update: the date of translation
#   (Including the leading "# " and any comments made by previous translators.
#   The FIRST blank line ends these header comments.)
#
# Followed by as many as needed:
#
# English phrase: translation
#   (One to a line. WITHOUT the leading "# ".
#   The "English phrase: ", including the colon ":", is provided by the
#   WebCalendar developers. Your part is the "translation".)
#
# The tools directory contains two perl scripts to help you:
#   - check_translation.pl
#       indicates if all text has been successfully translated.
#   - update_translation.pl
#       will parse the program files to find all translate ( 'phrase' ) and
#       tooltip ( 'phrase' ). It will arrange the phrases according to the page
#       (file) that contains the first occurance. Optionally, it can tag the
#       phrases that are not yet translated by putting
#       << MISSING >>
#       on the line above the phrase. And, if the phrase is an abbreviation,
#       it will include the full English text on the line below the phrase.
#
# Note: I'm attempting to cut down on the overall file size. If the "translation"
#       word / phrase is identical in your language and English, just use an "=" sign.
#
# Note:  You will notice the entry for "May_" below. There is a reason for this.
#        Translate "May_" to the full month name and "May" to the,
#        usually three-letter, month abbreviation (like "Oct" for "October").
#
# $Id$
# Translation last updated on 11-20-2007
