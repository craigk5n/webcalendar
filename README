Outstanding issues:
- No way to delete just a specific day of a repeating event
- No way to override the time of just a specific day of a repeating event
- Complete translatations (most are missing the translations for stuff
  related to repeating events)

Possible features for future releases:
- LDAP support
- User groups
- Custom access restrictions that can be defined by each user
- Some kind of shared public calendars.  Perhaps multiple shared public
  calendars that can be overlayed onto your own calendar.
- Allow users to not have JavaScript and/or CSS used
- Advances search (date ranges, and/or)
- Add comments to entries that will show up on the view page
- Data import (from Netscape Calendar's tab-delimted export or maybe
  from a Palm Pilot data file)
- Add support for repeating events to install-datebook
- Activity log
- Java client?
