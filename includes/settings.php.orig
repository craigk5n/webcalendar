# You can edit this file by hand.  Start by copying settings.php.orig
# to be settings.php
#
# This is not really a php file, but we use the .php file extension to
# prevent malicious users from downloading this file to obtain our
# database login.
#
# When you're done here, try accessing WebCalendar as an admin
# user and go to the System Settings page (admin.php) to change system
# settings.
#
# For ODBC use, ignore the db_host value and set 
# db_database to your full DSN

# Read-only mode: You can set this to true to create a read-only calendar.
# If you enable $single_user_login (below), no login will be required,
# making this a publicly viewable calendar.  In order to add events to
# a setup like this, you will need to setup another installation of this
# application that is not read-only.
# If $readonly is enabled in multi-user mode, only admin users will able
# to add/edit/delete events.
# NOTE: Approvals are not disabled in read-only.  You must also disable
# approvals if you don't want to use them.
# NOTE #2: Using $readonly has mostly been superceded by the new public
# access calendar (added in version 0.9.35) which allows
# a public access calendar with no login or a regular calendar user with
# a valid login.  This is configured in the admin web interface.
# If you want to use the new system (recommended), leave this $readonly
# setting set to "false".
readonly: false

# Are you setting this up as a multi-user system?
# You can always start as a single-user system and change to multi-user
# later.  To enable single-user mode, uncomment out the following line
# and set it to a login name (that you would use if you ever switched to
# multi-user).  In single-user mode, you will not be prompted for a login,
# nor will you be asked to select participants for events.
# NOTE: If you select single-user and then upgrade to multi-user later,
# you'll have to add in the login name you've set below to the cal_user
# table.  You will be able to do this from the web admin interface.
# Set $single_user to either true or false.  If true, make sure
# $single_user_login is defined.
single_user: false
#single_user_login: cknudsen

# Do you want to use web-based login or use HTTP authorization?
# NOTE: You can only use HTTP authorization if PHP is built as
# an Apache module.
# NOTE #2: There's no need to use this if you're running single
# user mode.
# Set the following to true to use http-based authorization.
# If you want to setup a public calendar with HTTP-based authentication,
# see FAQ in WebCalendar-SysAdmin.html for instructions.
use_http_auth: false

# user authentication module (user.php, user-ldap.php, user-nis.php)
# Note: if you enable LDAP support (with user-ladp.php), you will also
# need to modify user-ldap.php to configure some settings.
user_inc: user.php
