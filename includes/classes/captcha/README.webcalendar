The files in this directory are a CAPTCHA anti-spam class.
See the original README file for more info.
The captcha.php file was modified to configure its
use with WebCalendar.

NOTE: this CAPTCHA class does require the PHP GD extension.  See the PHP
pages at www.php.net for information on how to enable this extension.
