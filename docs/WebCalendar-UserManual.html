<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>WebCalendar is a calendar system. It is intended to be easy to setup and 
use while still providing advanced features and flexibility to serve the 
purposes of a widely varied user base. It can also be used as an events 
calendar for an organization or as a scheduling system for an intranet.</p>

<p>WebCalendar is an open source application. What does this mean for you? 
You get to use the application free of charge. (See the 
<a href="#license">licensing section</a> for more information on licensing.) 
Additionally, you have access to the WebCalendar developer community. You 
can post questions to various forums and have knowledgeable developers 
respond.</p>

<p>The primary site for WebCalendar development is at SourceForge.net:</p>
<pre><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/</a></pre>

<p>The first public release of WebCalendar was in December of 1999.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="users">Users and Events</a></h2>
<p>WebCalendar can be configured to operate in either single-user or
multi-user mode.<br />

<span class="note">Note:</span> If your WebCalendar is a single-user 
configuration, a large portion of this document will not apply.</p>

<p>All events in WebCalendar must be associated with one or more users. There 
is no limit to the number of users that can use WebCalendar (aside from 
system resources such as database space).

Each participant will have a status for the event: "Waiting for Approval,"
"Approved" or "Rejected."<br />

<span class="note">Note:</span> If your WebCalendar is configured to not 
require approvals, then participants will always appear as "Approved" for 
all events.</p>

<p>If you add an event with yourself as a participant, your status
will be "Approved" by default. If you include any other users, then
their status will be "Waiting for Approval" until they either approve or 
reject the event. If configured to do so, WebCalendar will email participants 
notifying them that there is a new event waiting for approval on his/her 
calendar.<br />

<span class="note">Note:</span> As the creator of the event, you will not 
receive this email notification because your status for the event is 
automatically set to "Approved."</p>

<p>When viewing the details of an event, the status of event participants will be designated as shown below:</p>

<img src="event_status.gif" alt="Event Status Screenshot" />
<br /><br />

<span class="note">Notes:</span>
<ul>
  <li>If you did not create the event, then you can only delete the 
  event from your own calendar. Other users will still have the event 
  on their calendar.</li>
  <li>If you did not create the event, you will not be able to edit the 
  event.  Only the user who created the event can edit it.</li>
  <li>If you see an event on another user's calendar that is not on 
  your calendar, the event details page will provide a link to add the 
  event to your calendar.</li>
  <li>All changes to an event (accepting/rejecting, updating, deleting)
  are logged and are viewable by the system administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="repeat">Repeating Events</a></h2>

<p>Repeating events may be used to create recurring event entries
on your calendar. This version of WebCalendar has adding many new features for
specifying repeating events in an attempt to become more compliant with RFC2445 (ical).
There are two mode of operation, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Expert Mode</strong>.
These modes are selectable when creating and event, but will be automatically selected based 
on the values of existing events. Please refer to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">
RFC2445</a> for a detailed discussion of complex recurrence rules.</p>

<h3>Ending</h3>
<p>You may elect to have an event repeat <strong>Forever</strong>, <strong>Use end date</strong> or
have the event repeat a set <strong>Number of times</strong>.</p>

<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>The "Frequency" field allows you to 
specify how often the event occurs. Typing "0" or "1" in the "Frequency" 
field tells WebCalendar the event occurs every time (every day for daily, 
every month for monthly, etc.). Typing "2" in the "Frequency" field will 
indicate the event should occur every other time (i.e. every other day for 
daily, every other month for monthly, etc.).</p>

<h3>Daily</h3>
<p>If you select "Daily", the event will repeat at the same time
every day until the end date (if specified) or the <em>Number of times</em> is reached. You can also
select <em>Weekdays  Only</em> to cause the event to skip weekends.<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the option to specify individual days of the week (<em>ByDay</em>) as
well as selecting specific months (<em>ByMonth</em>) that the event will repeat.</p>

<h3>Weekly</h3>
<p>If you select "Weekly", the event will repeat every week on the day(s) 
selected until the end date (if specified) or until the . You may select specific ByDay values to 
have your event repeat more than one day per week.<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the option to specify specific months (<em>ByMonth</em>) that 
the event will repeat.</p>

<h3>Monthly (by day)</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by day)", the event will repeat on the same
weekday of the month every month until the specified <em>End</em>.
For example, if the initial date is the second Monday of the month,
the event will repeat on the second Monday of each month.<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the option to specify individual days of the month (<em>ByDay</em>) as
well as selecting specific months that the event will repeat. You have the option to select any
combination of days within the month using the triple-state buttons, for example, you 
could select the the 1st Sunday (1SA), 3rd Thursday (3TH), and 5th Friday (5FR) of the month. 
You can also select days from the end of the month, for example -2SA would be the next to 
the last Saturday of the month. Any value that doesn't exist within the month will be ignored, 
like in the example above, not every month has a fifth Friday. In addition, specific months (<em>ByMonth</em>) 
within the year can be specified.</p>


<h3>Monthly (by day (from end))</h3>
<p>This option is no longer valid, as it is now rolled into Monthly ( by Day) using negative 
day (<em>ByDay</em>) values.</p>

<h3>Monthly (by date)</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by date)", the event will repeat on the
same date of the month every month until the <em>End</em>. 
For example, if you the initial date is May 12th, then the event
will repeat on June 12th and so on.<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the options to select days of the week (<em>ByDay</em>), 
specific months <em>ByMonthDay</em> to repeat and an option to select specific dates within the
month (<em>ByMonthDay</em>). With this option you can select any combination of dates within
the month, for example, the 3rd of each month (3), the 31st (31), the second from the end of the month
(-2) using the triple-state buttons. </p>

<h3>Monthly (by position)</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by position)", the event repeats will be calculated for the month
using the <em>End</em> and <em>ByDay</em>, then the option (<em>BySetPos</em>) will be applied.
For example, if you selected MO,TU,WE the normal habit would be to repeat every Monday, Tuesday, 
and Wednesday within the month. Specifying (<em>BySetPos</em>) 7 would narrow the final selection
to the 7th element of the original set of dates. It's sounds confusing I know...just try programming it :)<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the option to specify specific months to repeat. Please note that 
(<em>BySetPos</em>) is applied after all other ByXXX values, so selecting (<em>ByMonth</em>) may yield unexpected
results.</p>

<h3>Yearly</h3>
<p>If you select "Yearly", the event will repeat on the same date every 
year until the <em>End</em>.<br />
<strong>Expert Mode:</strong> Adds the (ByDay), (ByMonth), and (ByMonthDay) as described above. 
These settings are applied to each month specified by the (ByMonth)...basically like the Monthly 
(by Day/Date) options. Also, two user entered values are available. <em>ByWeekNo</em> allows one or
more week numbers to be entered separated by commas (1,2...53,-53,-52...-1). <em>ByYearDay</em> 
allows the user to enter days of the year to repeat separated by commas (1,2,...366,-366,-365...-1).</p>

<p>Please Note: All ByXXX values are evaluated by ANDing the values together with the following precedence.
 BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, and BYSETPOS</p>

<h3> Exclusions/Inclusions</h3>
<p>This option allows the exclusion or inclusion of dates for the repeat sequence. This setting is applied
after all ByXXX values are evaluated.</p>

<h2><a name="publicaccess">Public Access</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Public Access, you may skip 
this section.</p>

<p>Public Access is useful if you want to publish part of the calendar to 
a larger user base that isn't allowed to edit it.</p>

<p>If Public Access is enabled, an extra user will show up when 
creating a new event: the 'Public Access' user. To make an event visible 
to users that aren't logged in, simply select the 'Public Access' user as
a participant for the event(s).</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="subscriptions">Remote Subscriptions</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Remote Subscriptions,
you may skip this section.</p>

<p>If your administrator has enabled Remote Subscriptions, you may enable 
it for your personal account by clicking 'Admin' =&gt; 'Preferences' =&gt; 'Subscribe/Publish' 
and selecting 'Yes' &amp; save.</p>

<p>If a user has this option enabled, the URL for accessing the calendar via an 
external iCalendar-aware application (such as <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla Calendar</a> 
or <a href="http://apple.com/ical">Apple's iCal</a>) will be displayed.</p>

<p>If the 'Public Access' calendar is enabled, the Remote Subscriptions service can be 
enabled by following the same procedure as above in the Public Access preferences panel.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="external">External Users</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow External Users, you may skip this section.</p>

<p>External Users<a href="#g_externaluser">*</a> allow you to add 
participants to an event that are not WebCalendar users. When adding 
or editing an event, you will see a free text area titled "External 
Participants." In this area you can enter names of participants. 
If your system is configured to allow it, the External Participants 
will be notified via email when the event is created, and updated. In addition,
external  users will be reminded of an upcoming event via email, if the event
has a reminder set. They will not be provided a URL to access the calendar but
will receive and ics file as an attachment for inclusion in their own calendar
client. </p>
<p>External Participants should be specified one name per line (email address optional). 
All of the following would be legal entries:</p>
<pre>Joe Smith
Smith, Joe
Joe Smith &lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt;
&lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt;</pre>

<p>Email addresses within '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters will receive email notifications 
and reminders.</p>

<h2><a name="nonuser">NonUser Calendars</a></h2>
<p>NonUser Calendars<a href="#g_nonuser">*</a> allow you to 
maintain a calendar that is not associated with a user. Users can then 
either view the NonUser Calendar (if the system settings allow it) or 
add the NonUser Calendar as a layer to their own calendar. For additional 
information on layers, see the <a href="#layers">layers</a> documentation.</p>

<p>This can be used for resource management such as scheduling usage
of a conference room. If used in combination with <a href="#views">views</a>,
you can quickly &amp; easily view the availability of multiple conference rooms
on the same page.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="categories">Categories</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to use categories, you may skip this 
section.</p>

<p>Events may be associated with one or more categories, but it is not required.
Categories can be user-level or global. Each user maintains his/her
own list of user-level categories, while the system administrator
maintains the list of global categories.</p>
<p>When creating or editing event, you may specify the categories for the event.
If the category you select isn't a global category, and you select participants 
other than yourself for that event, other users will see "None" as the category. 
If you selected a global category, all users will be able to see the same category.</p>

<p>When viewing the calendar (month, week or day), a selection box is 
displayed near the top of the page that allows you to filter events based 
on a category. When you select a category from this menu, only events associated 
with that category will appear on your calendar.</p>

<p>If enabled, icons can also be uploaded and assigned to categories to be displayed 
before the event name. You will also be able to choose an icon from existing icons that have already been uploaded. This requires that a folder named <tt>icons</tt> exist in the WebCalendar directory.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="views">Views</a></h2>
<p>Views<a href="#g_view">*</a> allow you to look at the calendar of one or 
more users (or NonUser Calendars) at the same time. You can create a new 
view by clicking "Views" in the admin panel.</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>If you system is not configured to use Groups<a href="#g_group">*</a>, you may skip this 
section.</p>

<p>Groups allow systems with many users to divide users into smaller groups of 
users. Additionally, if configured to do so, users can only access calendars of 
users in the same group(s) (both when viewing the list of available calendars or when 
selecting participants for an event.</p>

<p>When adding or editing events, a "Select..." button will be available.
This button will popup a user selection window that will allow
event participants to be selected by group.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="layers">Layers</a></h2>
<p>Layers<a href="#g_layer">*</a> allow you to overlay one or more calendars 
on top of your own. You can add a new layer to your calendar by clicking 
"Layers" in the admin panel.</p>

<p>When adding the layer, you can choose a color. When an event
from that layer is displayed on your calendar, the text of the event will 
appear in the specified color.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> On slow servers, you may find that layers 
cause the month view to be considerably slower. Set your default view
to "Week" rather than "Month" in your <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> If you have more than one configuration of 
users that you would like to use with layers, you can create more than one 
"Daily" <a href="#views">View</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="boss">Assistant/Boss</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Assistant Mode, then you may skip 
this section.</p>

<p>Assistant Mode allows one user (the Assistant<a href="#g_assistant">*</a>) 
to help manage the calendar of another user (the Boss<a href="#g_boss">*</a>). 
The Boss creates the relationship in the calendar by clicking "Assistants" in 
the admin panel.</p>

<p>When the Boss has selected one or more assistants, each assistant
will see a new "Manage Calendar of" link at the bottom of the page.
This link will quickly bring the Assistant to a view of the Boss' calendar.
When adding an event from this page, the default participant will
be only the Boss.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>

<h2><a name="uac">User Access Control</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to use User Access Control, then you may skip 
this section.</p>

<p>If enabled, you may now set very detailed access controls to your calendar for 
other WebCalendar users. You can specify their access view,edit, and approve entries on your calendar and can further specify access to events, tasks, and journals (coming soon).</p>

<p>Access can also be granted/restricted to allow invitations, emails, and a very restrictive 
setting <strong>Can See Time Only</strong> that prevents the other user from viewing any details
of your events.</p>

<p>The <strong>DEFAULT CONFIGURATION</strong> selection will set the access for all users not otherwise granted/restricted access to your calendar.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>

<h2><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Usage -->
<dl>
  <dt>Why do weeks start with Sunday instead of Monday?</dt>
  <dd>The default setup of WebCalendar is to start weeks on Sunday. Your 
  system administrator can change the system default setting. You can 
  change the setting just for you in your <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Can I sync events with Palm/PocketPC/Outlook/iCal?</dt>
  <dd>Export support is available for Palm and anything that supports 
  iCal or vCal. Use the "Export" link at the bottom of each page.</dd>


  <dt>Why can't I edit an event that another user added to my calendar?</dt>
  <dd>If another user adds an event to your calendar, you cannot 
  edit the event. This is a security restriction. You can reject the 
  event rather than approve it, or you can delete the event from your 
  calendar.</dd>

  <dt>I'm trying to add a user as a participant to an event, but they do not 
  show up in the list of users.</dt>
  <dd>Your system administrator has enabled a feature that only allows 
  you to view users that are in the same group(s) that you are in. Make sure the 
  user is in one of the same groups that you are in.</dd>
