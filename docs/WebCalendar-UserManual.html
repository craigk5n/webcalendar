</p><hr><h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2><p>

WebCalendar is a multi-user calendar system.  It is intended to be
simple to setup and use while still providing advanced features and
flexibility to serve the purposes of a widely varied user base.
It can be used to as an events calendar for an organization or
as a scheduling system for an intranet.
</p><p>
WebCalendar is an open source application.  What does this
mean for you?  You get to use the application free of charge.
(See the
<a href="#license">licensing section</a> for more information
on licensing.)
Additionally, you have access to the WebCalendar developer
community.  You can post questions to various forums and
have knowledgeable developers respond.


</p><p>
The primary site for WebCalendar development is at SourceForge.net:
<blockquote>
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first public release of WebCalendar was in December of 1999.


</p><hr><h2><a name="users">Users and Events</a></h2><p>

</p><p>
WebCalendar can be configured to operate in either single-user or
multi-user mode.

<b>Note:</b>
If your installation of WebCalendar is a single-user configuration,
a large portion of this document will not apply.

</p><p>
All events entered into the system will be associated with one or
more users.  There is no limit to the number of users that can use
WebCalendar (aside from system resources such as database space).

Each user will have a status for the event: "Waiting for Approval,"
"Approved" or "Rejected."  (If your system is configured to not require
approvals, then all events will always be in the "Approved" status).

</p><p>
If you add an event with yourself as a participant, your status
will be "Approved" by default. If you include any other users, then
their status will be "Waiting for Approval".
If configured to do so, event participants will receive an
email notification indicating that there is a new event
waiting for approval.  (The user who creates the event will not
receive this email notification since their status will automatically
be set to "Approved.")
When viewing the full details of an event, the status of
event participants will be designated as seen below:

<center>
<h1>[SCREEN SHOT]</h1>
</center>


</p><p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>If you did not create an event, then you can only
  delete the event from your own calendar.  Other users
  will still have the event on their calendar.
<li>If you did not create the event, you will not be
  able to edit the event.  Only the user who created the
  event can edit it.
<li>If you see an event on another user's calendar that is not
  on your calendar, the event details page will provide a link
  to add the event to your calendar.
<li>All changes to an event (accepting/rejecting, updating, deleting)
  are logged and are viewable to the system administrator.
</ul>

</p><hr><h2><a name="repeat">Repeating Events</a></h2><p>

Repeating events may be used to create recurring event entries
on your calendar.
You may select an end date so that the event stops recurring
at the specified date.
The "Frequency" field allows you to specify how often the
event occurs.  A "0" or "1" in the "Frequency" field will indicate
the event occurs every time (every day for daily, every month for
monthly, etc.)
A "2" in the "Frequency" field will indicate the event should
happen every other time (every other day for daily, every other
month for monthly, etc.)

</p><h3>Daily</h3><p>
If you select "Daily", the event will repeat at the same time
every day until the end date (if specified).

</p><h3>Weekly</h3><p>
If you select "Weekly", the event will repeat every week
on the days selected
until the end date (if specified).
You <b>must</b> select days in the "Repeat Days" section
when using repeat "Weekly".

</p><h3>Monthly (by day)</h3><p>
If you select "Monthly (by day)", the event will repeat on the same
weekday of the month every month
until the end date (if specified).
For example, if the initial date is the second Monday of the month,
the event will repeat on every second Monday of each month.
</p><p>
<b>TIP:</b> This feature can be used to handle complicated
repeating events like Thanksgiving, which is the fourth Thursday
in November.  You would select the initial date to be the proper
Thanksgiving date and then enter "12" for the "Frequency".
This would tell WebCalendar that the event happens on the
fourth Thursday of the month on every 12th month, starting
in November.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> There currently is no way to indicate that an event
should occur on the last weekday of the month.

</p><h3>Monthly (by date)</h3><p>
If you select "Monthly (by date)", the event will repeat on the
same date of the month every month
until the end date (if specified).
For example, if you the initial date is May 12th, then the event
will repeat on June 12th and so on.

</p><h3>Yearly</h3><p>
If you select "Yearly", the event will repeat on the
same date every year
until the end date (if specified).

</p><hr><h2><a name="external">External Users</a></h2><p>

If your system is not configued to allow External Users,
you may skip this section.
</p><p>
External Users<sup><a href="#g_externaluser">*</a></sup>
allows you to add participants to an event
that are not WebCalendar users.  When adding or editing
an event, you will see a free text area titled "External Participants."
In this area you can enter names of participants.
If your system is configued to allow it, the External Participants
will receive email notifications and email reminders if their
email address was specified.
</p><p>
The proper way to specify External Participants is one name per line
with an option email address.  All of the following would be
legal entries:
<blockquote>
Joe Smith <br>
Smith, Joe <br>
Joe Smith &lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt; <br>
&lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt;
</blockquote>
When an email address is encountered (within the '&lt;' and '&gt;'),
that user will receive email notifications and reminders.

</p><hr><h2><a name="nonuser">NonUser Calendars</a></h2><p>

NonUser Calendars<sup><a href="#g_nonuser">*</a></sup>
allow you to maintain a calendar that is not
associated with a user.  Users can then either view the calendar
of the NonUser Calendar (if the system settings allow it) or add
the NonCalendar user as a layer to their own calendar.
(See <a href="#layers">Layers</a> documentation.)

</p><p>

This can be used for resource management such as scheduling usage
of a conference room.  If used in combination with <a href="#views">views</a>,
you could quickly view the availability of multiple conference rooms
on the same page.

</p><hr><h2><a name="categories">Categories</a></h2><p>

If your system is not configured to use categories,
you may skip this section.
</p><p>

Events may be associated with a category, but it is not required.
Categories can be user-level or global.  Each user maintains his
own list of user-level categories and the system administrator
maintains the list of global categories.

</p><p>
When creating or editing event, you may specify the category for the event.
If you include participants other than yourself, the category that
other users will see will be "None" (if you selected one of your
user-level categories) or the same category you selected
(if you selected a global category).


</p><p>
When viewing the calendar (month, week or day), you will see
a selection box near the top of the page that allows you to
filter events based on a category.  When you select a category
from this menu, only events associated with that category will
appear in your calendar.


</p><hr><h2><a name="views">Views</a></h2><p>

Views<sup><a href="#g_view">*</a></sup>
allow you to see the calendar of more than one user (or NonCalendar
User) at a time.
You can create a new view by using the "Manage Views" link at the
bottom of each page.
There are a handful of different types of views
summarized below.

</p><h3>Day</h3><p>
The "Day" view shows each users' availablity for the selected day.

<h1>[SCREEN SHOT]</h1>

</p><h3>Week (Users horizontal)</h3><p>

</p><h3>Month (on same calendar)</h3><p>

<h1>[SCREEN SHOT]</h1>
</center>


</p><hr><h2><a name="groups">Groups</a></h2><p>

If you system is not configured to use Groups<sup><a href="#g_group">*</a></sup>, you may skip this section.

</p><p>
Groups allow systems with many users to divide users into smaller
groups of users.
Additionally, if configured to do so, users will only be able
to access other users in the same group(s) either when viewing other
users' calendars or when selecting participants for an event.
</p><p>
When adding or editing events, a "Select..." button will be available.
This button will popup a user selection window that will allow
event participants to be selected by group.

</p><hr><h2><a name="layers">Layers</a></h2><p>

Layers<sup><a href="#g_layer">*</a></sup>
allow you to overlay another user's calendar on top of your
calendar.  You can add a new layer to your calendar
by selecting the "Edit Layers" link at the bottom of each page.
</p><p>
When adding the layer, you can choose a color.  When an event
from the layer specified in the layer is displayed on your calendar,
the text of the event will appear in this color.

</p><p>
<b>TIP:</b> On slow servers, you may find that layers cause the
month view to be considerably slower.  Set your default view
to be "Week" rather than "Month" in your <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.

</p><p>
<b>TIP:</b> If you have more than one configuration of users that you would
like to use with layers, you can create more
than one "Daily" <a href="#views">View</a> to do this.

</p><hr><h2><a name="boss">Assisant/Boss</a></h2><p>

If your system is not configured to allow Assistant Mode, then
you may skip this section.
</p><p>
Assistant Mode allows one user (the Assistant<sup><a href="#g_assistant">*</a></sup>) to help manage the
calendar of another user (the Boss<sup><a href="#g_boss">*</a></sup>).  The Boss creates the
relationship in the calendar by selecting the "Assistants" link
at the bottom of each page.
</p><p>
When the Boss has selected one or more assistants, each assitant
will see a new "Manage Calendar of" link at the bottom of the page.
This link will quickly bring the Assistant to a view of the Boss' calendar.
When adding an event from this page, the default participant will
be only the Boss.


</p><hr><h2><a name="pref">Preferences</a></h2><p>

</p><hr><h2><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h2><p>

<dl>

<dt>Why do weeks start with Sunday instead of Monday?</dt>
<dd>The default setup of WebCalendar is to start weeks on Sunday.
  Your system administator can change the system default setting.
  You can change the setting just for you in the
  <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</dd>

<dt>Can I sync events with Palm/PocketPC/Outlook/iCal?</dt>
<dd>Export support is avaialaboe for Palm and anything that
  supports iCal or vCal.
  Use the "Export" link at the bottom of each page.
  Importing is not yet available but is planned for a future release.</dd>

<dt>I added a weekly repeating event.  Why isn't it showing up?</dt>
<dd>Be sure to select the weekdays (Sunday,  Monday, etc.) that want
  the event to repeat on.  If you don't select at least one, there
  be no repeating event dates.</dd>

<dt>Why can't I edit an event that another user added to my calendar?</dt>
<dd>If another user adds an event to your calendar, you cannot
  edit the event.  This is a security restriction.
  You can reject the event rather than approve it,
  or you can delete the event from your calendar.</dd>

<dt>I'm trying to add a user as a participant to an event, but
  they do not show up in the list of users.</dt>
<dd>Your system administrator has enabled a feature that only allows
  you to be aware of users that are in the same group (or groups)
  that you are in.  Make sure the user is in one of the same groups
  that you are in.</dd>
