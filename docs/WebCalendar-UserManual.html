<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>WebCalendar is a multi-user calendar system.  It is intended to be
simple to setup and use while still providing advanced features and
flexibility to serve the purposes of a widely varied user base.
It can be used to as an events calendar for an organization or
as a scheduling system for an intranet.</p>

<p>WebCalendar is an open source application.  What does this
mean for you?  You get to use the application free of charge.
(See the <a href="#license">licensing section</a> for more information
on licensing.) Additionally, you have access to the WebCalendar developer
community.  You can post questions to various forums and have 
knowledgeable developers respond.</p>

<p>The primary site for WebCalendar development is at SourceForge.net:</p>
<pre><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/</a></pre>

<p>The first public release of WebCalendar was in December of 1999.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="users">Users and Events</a></h2>
<p>WebCalendar can be configured to operate in either single-user or
multi-user mode.<br />

<span class="note">Note:</span> If your installation of WebCalendar is a 
single-user configuration, a large portion of this document will not apply.
</p>

<p>All events entered into the system will be associated with one or
more users. There is no limit to the number of users that can use
WebCalendar (aside from system resources such as database space).

Each user will have a status for the event: "Waiting for Approval,"
"Approved" or "Rejected."  (If your system is configured to not require
approvals, then all events will always be in the "Approved" status).</p>

<p>If you add an event with yourself as a participant, your status
will be "Approved" by default. If you include any other users, then
their status will be "Waiting for Approval". If configured to do so, 
event participants will receive an email notification indicating that 
there is a new event waiting for approval. (The user who creates the 
event will not receive this email notification since their status will 
automatically be set to "Approved.") When viewing the full details of an 
event, the status of event participants will be designated as seen below:</p>

<img src="event_status.gif" alt="Event Status Screenshot" />
<br /><br />

<span class="note">Notes:</span>
<ul>
	<li>If you did not create the event, then you can only
  delete the event from your own calendar.  Other users
  will still have the event on their calendar.</li>
	<li>If you did not create the event, you will not be
  able to edit the event.  Only the user who created the
  event can edit it.</li>
	<li>If you see an event on another user's calendar that is not
  on your calendar, the event details page will provide a link
  to add the event to your calendar.</li>
	<li>All changes to an event (accepting/rejecting, updating, deleting)
	are logged and are viewable to the system administrator.</li>
</ul>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="repeat">Repeating Events</a></h2>

<p>Repeating events may be used to create recurring event entries
on your calendar. You may select an end date so that the event stops 
recurring at the specified date. The "Frequency" field allows you to 
specify how often the event occurs. A "0" or "1" in the "Frequency" 
field will indicate the event occurs every time (every day for daily, 
every month for monthly, etc.) A "2" in the "Frequency" field will 
indicate the event should happen every other time (every other day for 
daily, every other month for monthly, etc.)</p>

<h3>Daily</h3>
<p>If you select "Daily", the event will repeat at the same time
every day until the end date (if specified).</p>

<h3>Weekly</h3>
<p>If you select "Weekly", the event will repeat every week
on the days selected until the end date (if specified). You 
<strong>must</strong> select days in the "Repeat Days" section
when using repeat "Weekly".</p>

<h3>Monthly (by day)</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by day)", the event will repeat on the same
weekday of the month every month until the end date (if specified).
For example, if the initial date is the second Monday of the month,
the event will repeat on every second Monday of each month.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> This feature can be used to handle 
complicated repeating events like Thanksgiving, which is the fourth 
Thursday in November. You would select the initial date to be the proper 
Thanksgiving date and then enter "12" for the "Frequency".
This would tell WebCalendar that the event happens on the fourth 
Thursday of the month on every 12th month, starting in November.</p>

<h3>Monthly (by day (from end))</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by day(from end))", the event will repeat
on the same weekday of the month (counting back from the end of the month).
For example, if the initial date is the last Friday of the month,
the event will repeat on every last Friday of each month.</p>

<h3>Monthly (by date)</h3>
<p>If you select "Monthly (by date)", the event will repeat on the
same date of the month every month until the end date (if specified). 
For example, if you the initial date is May 12th, then the event
will repeat on June 12th and so on.</p>

<h3>Yearly</h3>
<p>If you select "Yearly", the event will repeat on the same date every 
year until the end date (if specified).</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="publicaccess">Public Access</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Public Access, you may skip 
this section.</p>

<p>Public Access is useful if you want to publish part of the calendar to 
a larger userbase that isn't allowed to edit it.</p>

<p>If Public Access is turned on, an extra user will show up when 
creating a new event: the 'Public Access' user. To make an event visible 
to users that aren't logged in, simply include the 'Public Access' user 
to the list of participants.</p>

<p>Note: Setting the 'Access' field to 'Confidential' will still publish 
the event if you include 'Public Access' in the event.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="subscriptions">Remote Subscriptions</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Remote Subscriptions,
you may skip this section.</p>

<p>When Remote Subscriptions are enabled for the site, a user can enable 
it for his account by setting 'Admin', 'Preferences', 'Subscribe/Publish' 
to 'Yes'.</p>

<p>If a user has this option turned on, the URL listed there can be used 
by external iCalendar-aware applications (like Mozilla Calendar or Apple 
iCal) to view the calendar.</p>

<p>The 'Public Access' calendar, if any, can be enabled by the administrator, 
and accessed using that URL with username '__public__'.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="external">External Users</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configued to allow External Users, you may skip this 
section.</p>

<p>External Users<a href="#g_externaluser">*</a> allows you to 
add participants to an event that are not WebCalendar users. When adding 
or editing an event, you will see a free text area titled "External 
Participants." In this area you can enter names of participants. 
If your system is configued to allow it, the External Participants 
will receive email notifications and email reminders if their 
email address was specified.</p>

<p>The proper way to specify External Participants is one name per line
with an option email address.  All of the following would be legal entries:</p>
<pre>Joe Smith
Smith, Joe
Joe Smith &lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt;
&lt;jsmith@xxx.com&gt;</pre>

<p>When an email address is encountered (within the '&lt;' and '&gt;'),
that user will receive email notifications and reminders.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="nonuser">NonUser Calendars</a></h2>
<p>NonUser Calendars<a href="#g_nonuser">*</a> allow you to 
maintain a calendar that is not associated with a user. Users can then 
either view the calendar of the NonUser Calendar (if the system settings 
allow it) or add the NonCalendar user as a layer to their own calendar.
(See <a href="#layers">Layers</a> documentation.)</p>

<p>This can be used for resource management such as scheduling usage
of a conference room.  If used in combination with <a href="#views">views</a>,
you could quickly view the availability of multiple conference rooms
on the same page.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="categories">Categories</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to use categories, you may skip this 
section.</p>

<p>Events may be associated with a category, but it is not required.
Categories can be user-level or global.  Each user maintains his
own list of user-level categories and the system administrator
maintains the list of global categories.</p>
<p>When creating or editing event, you may specify the category for the event.
If you include participants other than yourself, the category that
other users will see will be "None" (if you selected one of your
user-level categories) or the same category you selected (if you selected a 
global category).</p>

<p>When viewing the calendar (month, week or day), you will see
a selection box near the top of the page that allows you to
filter events based on a category.  When you select a category
from this menu, only events associated with that category will
appear in your calendar.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="views">Views</a></h2>
<p>Views<a href="#g_view">*</a> allow you to see the calendar of 
more than one user (or NonCalendar User) at a time. You can create a new 
view by using the "Manage Views" link at the bottom of each page. There 
are a handful of different types of views summarized below.</p>

<h3>Day</h3>
<p>The "Day" view shows each users' availablity for the selected day.</p>
	<img src="day_view.gif" alt="Day View Screenshot" />

<h3>Week (Users horizontal)</h3>
	<img src="week_view_h.gif" alt="Week (Users Horizontal) Screenshot" />

<h3>Week (Users vertical)</h3>
	<img src="week_view_v.gif" alt="Week (Users Vertical) Screenshot" />

<h3>Week (Timebar)</h3>
	<img src="week_view_t.gif" alt="Week (Timebar) Screenshot" />

<h3>Month (Side By Side)</h3>
	<img src="month_view.gif" alt="Month (Side By Side) Screenshot" />

<h3>Month (On Same Calendar)</h3>
	<img src="month_view_2.gif" alt="Month (On Same Calendar) Screenshot" />
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>If you system is not configured to use Groups<a href="#g_group">*</a>, you may skip this section.</p>

<p>Groups allow systems with many users to divide users into smaller groups of 
users. Additionally, if configured to do so, users will only be able
to access other users in the same group(s) either when viewing other
users' calendars or when selecting participants for an event.</p>

<p>When adding or editing events, a "Select..." button will be available.
This button will popup a user selection window that will allow
event participants to be selected by group.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="layers">Layers</a></h2>
<p>Layers<a href="#g_layer">*</a> allow you to overlay another 
user's calendar on top of your calendar. You can add a new layer to your 
calendar by selecting the "Edit Layers" link at the bottom of each page.</p>

<p>When adding the layer, you can choose a color.  When an event
from the layer specified in the layer is displayed on your calendar,
the text of the event will appear in this color.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> On slow servers, you may find that layers 
cause the month view to be considerably slower. Set your default view
to be "Week" rather than "Month" in your <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</p>

<p><span class="tip">TIP:</span> If you have more than one configuration of 
users that you would like to use with layers, you can create more than one 
"Daily" <a href="#views">View</a> to do this.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="boss">Assisant/Boss</a></h2>
<p>If your system is not configured to allow Assistant Mode, then you may skip 
this section.</p>

<p>Assistant Mode allows one user (the Assistant<a href="#g_assistant">*</a>) to help manage the calendar of another user (the Boss<a href="#g_boss">*</a>).  The Boss creates the relationship in the calendar by selecting the "Assistants" link at the bottom of each page.</p>

<p>When the Boss has selected one or more assistants, each assitant
will see a new "Manage Calendar of" link at the bottom of the page.
This link will quickly bring the Assistant to a view of the Boss' calendar.
When adding an event from this page, the default participant will
be only the Boss.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<h2><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Why do weeks start with Sunday instead of Monday?</dt>
<dd>The default setup of WebCalendar is to start weeks on Sunday.
  Your system administator can change the system default setting.
  You can change the setting just for you in the
  <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</dd>

<dt>Can I sync events with Palm/PocketPC/Outlook/iCal?</dt>
<dd>Export support is available for Palm and anything that
  supports iCal or vCal.
  Use the "Export" link at the bottom of each page.
  Importing is not yet available but is planned for a future release.</dd>

<dt>I added a weekly repeating event.  Why isn't it showing up?</dt>
<dd>Be sure to select the weekdays (Sunday,  Monday, etc.) that want
  the event to repeat on.  If you don't select at least one, there
  be no repeating event dates.</dd>

<dt>Why can't I edit an event that another user added to my calendar?</dt>
<dd>If another user adds an event to your calendar, you cannot
  edit the event.  This is a security restriction.
  You can reject the event rather than approve it,
  or you can delete the event from your calendar.</dd>

<dt>I'm trying to add a user as a participant to an event, but
  they do not show up in the list of users.</dt>
<dd>Your system administrator has enabled a feature that only allows
  you to be aware of users that are in the same group (or groups)
  that you are in.  Make sure the user is in one of the same groups
  that you are in.</dd>
