    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>PHP 7.4 or later: PHP 7.0-7.3 and 5.X are no longer supported since they have reach <a href="https://php.net/supported-versions.php" target="_blank">end-of-life status</a>. Expect only PHP 8 support sometime soon.</li>
      <li>Database (see <a href="#database">below</a>)</li>
      <li>CSS-enabled browser:
        <ul>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
          <li>Opera</li>
          <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
          <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
          <li>Apple Safari</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>JavaScript-enabled browser</li>
      <li>If not using HTTP-based authentication, then browser cookies are required</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a id="database">You must have one of the following databases installed</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MySQL/MariaDB</li>
      <li>IBM DB2</li>
      <li>Interbase</li>
      <li>MS SQL Server</li>
      <li>ODBC</li>
      <li>Oracle 8+</li>
      <li>PostgreSQL</li>
      <li>SQLite</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> PHP comes bundled with SQLite support. SQLite is an embedded file-based database. If your hosting service supports PHP, you should be able to create as many SQLite databases as you like (since each database is just a file).</p>
    <p>For the database you choose, you must have its drivers built into PHP. For example, to use MySQL, PHP must be compiled with MySQL support (which is the default setting when installing PHP). See the PHP pages (<a href="http://php.net" title="Open in new window" target="_blank">php.net</a>) for more information on setting up PHP.</p>
    <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> If you want to use gradient background images, PHP must be compiled with the GD library.</p>
    <p>You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module. You'll get better performance with PHP setup as a module. Not only will you not have to deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's database connection pooling. Additionally, this application can use a form/cookie-based authentication or traditional HTTP authentication. For traditional HTTP authentication, PHP must be built as an Apache module.</p>
    <p>If you are planning on using email reminders, you will need to build PHP as a CGI in order to run the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script. It is recommended to have a module-based PHP for your web server and then a second PHP build to create the CGI version.</p>
    <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> Some Linux distributions come with both a module-based PHP with Apache and a standalone PHP binary. Check for <span class="tt">/usr/bin/php</span> to see if you already have the PHP standalone executable. If it's there, you can use the following command to see what version of PHP you have:<br><br><span class="tt" style="margin-inline-start: 50px;">/usr/bin/php -v</span></p>

    <a id="fileunpacking"></a>
    <h2>File Unpacking</h2>
    <p>Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where your web server will find it. (See your web server documentation for information.)</p>
    <p>By default, unpacking WebCalendar will create its own directory when you unpack it. The new directory name will typically contain the version name (such as <span class="tt">WebCalendar-1.9.9</span>). You can rename this directory after unpacking the files if you prefer a directory name like <span class="tt">calendar</span> or <span class="tt">webcalendar</span>. Keep in mind that unless you remap the directory (via your web server's configuration settings), it will be part of the URL for the calendar.</p>
    <a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a>
    <hr>
    <a id="appsetup"></a>
    <h2>Application Installation</h2>
    <p>WebCalendar now includes an installation script that will guide you through the entire installation process. It should run automatically when first accessing a new installation or when a major version upgrade has been performed. The installation script can always be rerun if needed by adding <span class="tt">install/index.php</span> to your base WebCalendar URL.</p>
    <h3>WebCalendar Installation Wizard: Step 1</h3>
    <p>When first run, the installation script will prompt you for a <em>Configuration Wizard Password</em> that will protect against unauthorized tampering. Until this password is set, your WebCalendar installation and possibly your database are vulnerable to attack. Once, you've set your password, be sure to write it down. If forgotten, the only way to recover is to manually edit the <span class="tt">install/settings.php</span> file.</p>
    <p>The installation script will now check several prerequisites and report the results. Any item that appears in <span style="color: var(--red)">RED</span> should be corrected before continuing.</p>

  <p class="b">Timezone Conversion</p>
  <p>If upgrading WebCalendar from a previous version, you may be prompted to perform a Timezone Conversion. WebCalendar version 1.0.4 and earlier stored event date and time in the server's timezone. As of v1.1.0, all event date and time information is stored as UTC time. So, a one-time conversion of existing events will required to prevent event displayed times from appearing incorrectly.</p>

  <p>Application Name: The default value <strong>Title</strong> will be translated into <strong>WebCalendar</strong> into the user's language. Any other entry will not be translated unless entries are made into the appropriate language.txt files.</p>
  <p>Server URL: This should be the full URL to access your WebCalendar installation.The trailing "/" is required for proper operation. If this field is left blank, WebCalendar will calculate the proper value and store it in the database.</p>
  <p>User Authentication: You can configure the calendar to run in single-user<a href="#g_singleuser">*</a> mode or multi-user<a href="#g_multiuser">*</a> mode. If this is your first time using the calendar, it's easier to try single-user. You can always switch to multi-user later. Leave <span class="tt">single_user</span> set to "false" (the default) for multi-user or set it to "true" and set the value of <span class="tt">single_user_login</span> to a login name of your liking to set the system to single-user mode. (And be sure to set the value of <span class="tt">single_user_login</span> to the login that you would choose if you decide to switch to multi-user mode some day.)</p>
  <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode, make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the <span class="tt">single_user_login</span> variable to. You will need to do this via the database (mysql, sqlplus, etc.) Look in the <span class="tt">tables-mysql.sql</span> (or <span class="tt">tables-oracle.sql</span>, etc.) to see the example of adding in the "admin" user.</p>
  <p>If you are setting up a multi-user calendar, you will need to choose how your users are authenticated. You must change the settings of <span class="tt">use_http_auth</span> and <span class="tt">user_inc</span> to setup which authentication method to use.</p>
  <p>You currently have five choices:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Web-based authentication (login/passwords verified in the WebCalendar database):<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = false</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user.php</span></li>
    <li>HTTP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by the web server):<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = true</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user.php</span><br>... and don't forget to setup your web server to handle user authentication.<br><span class="note">Note:</span> In order to use HTTP-based authentication, PHP must be setup as a module for your server rather than a CGI.</li>
    <li>NIS-based authentication (login/passwords verified by NIS):<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = false</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user-nis.php</span><br>Additional configuration settings will need to be set in <span class="tt">includes/user-nis.php</span>.</li>
    <li>LDAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by LDAP server):<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = false</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user-ldap.php</span><br>Additional configuration settings will need to be set in <span class="tt">includes/user-ldap.php</span>.</li>
    <li>IMAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by IMAP server):<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = false</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user-imap.php</span><br>Additional configuration settings will need to be set in <span class="tt">includes/user-imap.php</span>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Read-Only: Determines whether events can be added to your WebCalendar.</p>
  <p>Environment: Normally set this <strong>Production</strong>. Development will allow more verbose sql logging and should not be used unless needed.</p>
  <p>After saving your settings, you should be provided with a <strong>Launch WebCalendar</strong> button that will open WebCalendar in a separate browser window.</p>
  <p class="b">Congratulations! You have successfully installed WebCalendar on your system.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that if you want to use reminders, you will need to setup the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script (see below) and keep your admin setting for "Email enabled" set to "Yes" on the admin settings page.</p>
  <p>At this point, your WebCalendar installation should be up and running. To access WebCalendar open up your favorite web browser and type in the URL. The URL will depend on where you installed WebCalendar.</p>
  <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> On a multi-user system, the only user account created during installation has the username of "admin" and a password of "admin". You should create a new admin account and delete this one for security reasons.</p>

  <h2>Configuring as Event Calendar</h2>
  <p>If you intend to use WebCalendar as an event calendar, you will need to enable "Public Access" in the System Settings with the following steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Login to WebCalendar as an administrator (the default username is 'admin' and password 'admin').</li>
    <li>Click on the "Admin" link at the bottom of any page.</li>
    <li>Click on the "System Settings" button.</li>
    <li>Click on the "Public Access" tab.</li>
    <li>Select "Yes" for "Allow public access".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This will allow users to access WebCalendar without a username and password. Only events that are created with the "Public User" as an event participant will show up in your event calendar for users who have not logged in. If events are not showing up on your public calendar, make sure the events have the "Public User" as a participant and the event has been approved.</p>
  <a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a>
  <hr>
  <a id="users"></a>
  <h2>Creating Users</h2>
  <p>After logging in as an admin user (the initial username is "admin" with password "admin"), you will see a common set of links at the bottom of each page. Follow these steps to create a new user:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Login to WebCalendar as an admin user</li>
    <li>Click on the "Admin" link at the bottom of any WebCalendar page</li>
    <li>Click on the "Users" button</li>
    <li>Click on the "Add New User" link</li>
    <li>Fill out the form with details for the new user (email address is optional)</li>
    <li>Click on the "Save" button</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> On a single-user system, you do not need to create any users.</p>
  <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> For an event calendar, you do not need to create a user for the "public user".</p>

  <h2>Setting Up Email Reminders</h2>
  <p>PHP does not come with a utility for executing time-based jobs. So, in order to check periodically for email reminders, a shell script was written in PHP. You will need two things to get this working:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You should have a version of PHP built as a CGI (so that you can run php from the command line). This does not mean you must build all of PHP as a CGI. You can still build PHP as a module for your web server and then build the CGI-based PHP later.<br><span class="note">Note:</span> Many Linux distributions and some Windows LAMP packages come with the PHP built for CGI.</li>
    <li>You must setup cron (on Linux/UNIX) or something like cron for Windows to run the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script periodically.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Building PHP as a CGI is outside the scope of these instructions. But, if you read the PHP instructions, you'll see that the default build settings will build the CGI-based PHP. If you really can't do this (perhaps you don't have permission to install anything new on the system), skip down a couple of paragraphs to an alternate solution that does not require PHP CGI.</p>
  <p>For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of a user. (This would be the same user that the web server process runs as.)<pre class="tt">1 * * * * cd /some/directory/webcalendar/tools; ./send_reminders.php</pre></p>
  <p>Of course, replace the directory location to wherever the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> file can be found. If you moved this out of the tools directory (which is recommended for security reasons), be sure to update <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> since it needs to know where to find other WebCalendar files.</p>
  <p>If you cannot setup PHP as a CGI or have no idea how, you can leave <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> in its current location and access it via a URL. IMHO, this is not the best choice, but it still works. Setup a cron job to access the URL. For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of a user.<pre class="tt">1 * * * * wget http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php &gt; /dev/null</pre></p>
  <p>Some users have reported the following works better for their configuration.<pre class="tt">1 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php</pre></p>
  <p>You should test this from the command line first to make sure your setup is correct. If you do not have <span class="tt">wget</span> installed on your system, you can use any tool (lynx, perl script, etc.) that is capable of making an HTTP request for this.</p>

      <dd>Text to display as explained above.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>User Access Control</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>User Access Control enabled</dt>
      <dd>User Access Control provides more advanced control of user access permissions. If enabled, a "User Access Control" button will appear on the main Admin page and/or on the Settings menu of the NEW top menu. This page will allow you to configure: </dd>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>which functions in the system each user can access</li>
          <li>which user calendars each user can access (user A can edit events on user B's calendar, etc.)</li>

    </dl>
    <h3>NonUser Calendars</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Nonuser Calendars Enabled</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, you may create "nonuser calendars" in WebCalendar. A nonuser calendar is a calendar without a user login. It can be used to manage a resource like a conference room's availability. Or it can be used to place common events (like holidays) that multiple users may want to access as a layer. You will need to enable nonuser calendars in order to subscribe to remote iCalendar URLs from within WebCalendar (allowing the events from an iCalendar or hCalendar file elsewhere on the net to appear in your WebCalendar calendar.)</dd>
      <dt>Display in participants list at</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, then nonuser calendars can be selected as participants to events.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Reports enabled</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, user's will be able to create and generate reports.</dd>
      <dt><em>Allow remote subscriptions</em></dt>
      <dd>If enabled, user's will be able enable their own subscription settings. There are currently two main ways to publish events with WebCalendar.</dd>
      <dd>
        <ul style="margin-inline-start:70px;">
          <li><strong>publish.php</strong> will provide outbound publishing to a calendar client</li>
          <li><strong>icalclient.php</strong> will provide two-way full synchronization between WebCalendar and another calendar client such as Sunbird, Apple iCal. (PHP 4.3+ required)</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Allow remote calendars</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, user's will be able to add a special type Non-User Calendar that includes a URL that point to the remote location. The user can manually synchronize the remote calendars if desired. In addition, <span class="tt">tool/reload_remotes.php</span> can be set up as a cron job to automatically reload all remote calendars as desired. Currently both iCalendar and hCalendar calendars can be consumed by WebCalendar. The calendar type should be automatically detected based on the URL and calendar content. Users will need to create a layer to make a remote calendar visible on their calendars, just like regular Non-User Calendars.</dd>
      <dt>Enable RSS feed</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, a link is added to all pages that permits some browsers to create a persistent RSS feed to that page. Currently, only Firefox and IE 7.0 supports this functionality. Also, the setting will enable the use of the rss.php script generate RSS feeds to RSS clients. User's will also be required to enable this feature in their respective preference settings.</dd>
      <dt>Categories enabled</dt>
      <dd>Specifies if category features should be enabled</dd>
      <dt>Category Icon Upload enabled</dt>
      <dd>Specifies if category icons can be uploaded by users. This requires that a folder named <span class="tt">icons</span> exist in the WebCalendar directory.</dd>
      <dt><em>Display small task list</em></dt>
      <dd>If enabled, a small task window will be displayed in the month and day calendars. These tasks are compatible with the VTODO component of RFC2445 (iCalendar)</dd>
      <dt><em>Display tasks in Calendars</em></dt>
      <dd>If enabled, tasks are displayed along with events in calendars. The date they appear is the due date but if the due date has passed without the task being completed, the task will shift to the current day.</dd>
      <dt>Allow external users</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, the create/edit event page will contain a text area to include the names (and optional email address) of event participants that are not calendar users.</dd>
      <dt>External users can receive email notifications</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, event participants entered into the External Participants area will receive email notifications at the same time as calendar users (if an email address was specified for the External Participant).</dd>
      <dt>External users can receive email reminders</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, event participants entered into the External Participants area will receive email reminders at the same time as calendar users (if an email address was specified for the External Participant).</dd>
      <dt>Allow self-registration</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, new users are permitted to setup their own accounts and log into WebCalendar without admin intervention. <span style="color: var(--red)">Use with caution!</span></dd>
      <dt>Restrict self-registration to blacklist</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, admin can configure the includes/blacklist.php to restrict or permit self-registration based on the user's IP. This will restrict access to existing users or new user's set up by admin. Details and examples are available in the top of the file.</dd>
      <dt>Generate passwords and send to new users</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, self-registration user's will be emailed a randomly generated password that they can then use to access WebCalendar normally. Hopefully, this will prevent some spammers and hackers from misusing the self-registration process.</dd>
      <dt>Allow file attachments to events</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, attachments can be uploaded and associated with events. The attachments are stored in the database, so care should be taken if performance is an issue. Additionally, permission may extended to participants and/or anyone.</dd>
      <dt>Allow comments to events</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, comments can be associated with events. Additionally, permission may extended to participants and/or anyone.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Email</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Email enabled</dt>

    <h2>Custom Event Fields</h2>
    <p>You may want to customize the event-specific fields found in the <span class="tt">includes/site_extras.php</span> field. If this is your first time using the calendar, you can skip this step and come back later since this step is <em>optional</em>.</p>
    <p>You can use this feature to add extra fields to your calendar events. For example, you can add a URL, a contact email address, or a pulldown containing predefined attributes.</p>
    <p>When defining a new custom field, the following types listed below are available. "Arg 1" and "Arg 2" have different meaning depending on the type of field. In some cases, "Arg 1" and "Arg 2" are not used.</p>

<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Installation/Setup -->
      <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on Windows?</dt>
      <dd>The easiest way to do this is to try one of the prepackaged bundles that will install all of these for you:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://xampp-windows.en.softonic.com/download" title="Open in new window" target="_blank">XAMPP</a></li>

 -->
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on Mac OS X?</dt>
      <dd>You can use the built-in Apache/PHP installed on Mac OS X. However, this does not include MySQL. An easier way to setup WebCalendar would be to use one of the following packages:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" title="Open in new window" target="_blank">XAMPP</a></li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on UNIX/Linux?</dt>
      <dd>There are many online instructions on how to do this. Here are a few:
        <ul>

        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>I've finished the install. What is the login to WebCalendar?</dt>
      <dd>After the initial creation of the database tables, there will be a single user account created with the username "admin" and the password set to "admin" as well.<br><span class="note">Note:</span> This account is intended to get your started. You should create a new admin account and delete this one.</dd>
      <dt><a id="samplepublic">I want to use WebCalendar as an events calendar for my organization. How do I set it up to do this?</a></dt>
      <dd>You will want to setup WebCalendar to use public access.
        <ol>
          <li>Setup your <span class="tt">settings.php</span> file as a multi-user system (see <a href="#appsetup">instructions</a>).</li>
          <li>In System Settings, set "Allow public access" to "Yes."</li>
          <li>If you want people to be able to submit new events through public access, set "Public access can add events" to "Yes."</li>
          <li>If you set "Public access can add events" to "Yes", set the setting for "Public access new events require approval" to your liking. If you set this to "Yes," an admin user will need to approve any new events before they will appear on the public access calendar.</li>
          <li>Login using one of the accounts you have setup. Add a new event, and select "Public User" as one of the participants.</li>
          <li>If you have enabled "Require event approvals" in your System Settings, then you will need to approve the new event. Choose the "Unapproved Events" at the bottom of any page (you must be an admin user to access this). You will be presented with a list of unapproved events (for both the current user and for the Public User account). Approve the new event for the Public User.</li>
          <li>Go to the Login page. You will see a "Access public calendar" link that will bring you to the calendar for public access.</li>
          <li>By default, the index.php page should send users to the public calendar.</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
      <dt>How can I add holidays to the calendar?</dt>
      <dd>There is no built-in support for holidays because it is not necessary. You can add holidays into WebCalendar by importing one of the many iCalendar holiday files that are freely available.
<!-- [bad links]
        A good resource for free iCalendar files is
        <a href="http://icalshare.com" target="_blank">iCalShare</a>.
        For example, the U.S. holiday iCalendar file can be downloaded from:
        <blockquote>
          <a href="http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521" target="_blank">
            http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521</a> </blockquote>
 -->
        If you don't want each individual user to have to import the holiday calendar, you can use nonuser calendars. First, make sure nonuser calendars are enabled in your system settings. Then, from Admin-&gt;Users, you can access nonuser calendars. Create a new nonuser calendar (such as "usholidays"). Then, notify your users that they can add this nonuser calendar as a layer to their own calendar in order to see the holidays.
      </dd>
      <dt>Why are deleted events still present in the database?</dt>
      <dd>When you delete an event from your calendar, it is not deleted from the database. Instead, it is marked as deleted. This allows the system administrator access to information even after it is deleted.</dd>
      <dt>Can I setup more than one public calendar?</dt>
      <dd>You cannot directly setup two public calendars. However, there are two options for emulating this type of functionality:
        <ul>
          <li>You can <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#categories">create global categories</a> and point users to the calendar with only a certain category displayed.</li>
          <li>You can setup multiple NonUser calendars and enable public access viewing of other users' calendars. You can then link directly to the calendar of one of the NonUser calendars, or you can <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#views">setup a view</a> that contains the calendar of one or more of the NonUser calendars.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I change the title "Public Access" at the top of the calendar?</dt>
      <dd>In the file <span class="tt">translations/English-US.txt</span>, change the line that says "Public Access" to what you want it to say on the right side.<br><br>Example:<pre>Public Access: Foobar Event Calendar</pre></dd>
      <dt>Can I embed WebCalendar as a component on another web page?</dt>
      <dd>WebCalendar is meant to be run as a standalone web application. You can customize the appearance of WebCalendar to match your existing site. To do this, In System Settings, set both "Custom header" and "Custom trailer" to "Yes" and press the "Edit" button to enter the header and trailer content.<br>If you are looking to just include a list of upcoming events in one of your web pages, you can use the <span class="tt">upcoming.php</span> page in WebCalendar to do this. Edit the top of this file to configure options. (These settings will likely move into System Settings in subsequent release.) You can then use an <span class="tt">iframe</span> elsewhere on your web site as in the example below: <pre>&lt;iframe src="upcoming.php" width="300" height="250" scrolling="yes"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre> Include this HTML anywhere on any of your pages. By default, the events from the public calendar will be loaded (so you must have "Public Access" enabled in System Settings). You can override this with another user's calendar. (See <span class="tt">upcoming.php</span> for instructions on this.)<br><br>If you would like to display a small calendar (like the ones on the month view), you can add the following example. There are some configuration options available in the top of this file as well. You can then use an <span class="tt">iframe</span> elsewhere on your web site as in the example below: <pre>&lt;iframe src="minical.php" width="180" height="200" scrolling="yes"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre></dd>
      <dt>How do I customize the appearance of WebCalendar so that it matches the rest of my site?</dt>
      <dd>You can customize the appearance of WebCalendar to match your existing site. To do this, In System Settings, set both "Custom header" and "Custom trailer" to "Yes", and press the "Save" button. Then click on the "Edit" button to enter your site content. The custom header will be included after the document's HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag but before any WebCalendar content. The custom trailer will be included after the WebCalendar content and before the document's HTML <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. If you want to add JavaScript or Stylesheet data, you can use the "Custom script/stylesheet" option on the same System Settings page. Any content entered will be included within the document's HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.</dd>
      <dt>How do I add a new translation?</dt>
      <dd>It's a fairly simple process. If you've ever translated a C-based app that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem. The I18N support was based on GNU's <a href="http://gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html" title="Open in new window" target="_blank">gettext</a>. Here's what you need to do.
        <ol>
          <li>look in the "translations" directory</li>
          <li>copy the <span class="tt">English-US.txt</span> file into what you'd like to call your language data file. (e.g. <span class="tt">cp English-US.txt French.txt</span>)</li>
          <li>Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ": " into the new language. Do <em>not</em> alter the text to the left of the ": ".</li>
          <li>When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory. Run the <span class="tt">check_translation.pl</span> script on your new data file to make sure you have all the needed translations. (e.g. <span class="tt">perl check_translation.pl French</span>)</li>
          <li>Add the new language to both the $languages array and the $browser_languages arrays defined in <span class="tt">includes/translate.php</span>.</li>
          <li>Test it out...</li>
          <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/craigk5n/webcalendar/pulls" target="_blank">pull request on Github</a>.</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I update an existing translation?</dt>
      <dd>Just open up the translation file in the <span class="tt">translations</span> directory with your favorite text editor (like vi, vim, emacs, pico, Notepad, etc.). In particular look for places where missing translations are indicated. All missing translations should be marked with a "&lt;&lt;&nbsp;MISSING&nbsp;&gt;&gt;" note. and typically the English version of the translation will also be included on the following line (as in the example below):
        <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING &gt;&gt;
# Edit:
#
        </pre><br>For some text, an abbreviation may be used rather than the English text. In those cases, the full text will be noted as in the following example:
        <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING &gt;&gt;
# custom-script-help:
# English text: Allows entry of custom Javascript or stylesheet text that
# will be inserted into the HTML "head" section of every page.
#
        </pre><br>When you're done making changes, move into the <span class="tt">tools</span> directory. Run the <span class="tt">check_translation.pl</span> script on your new data file to make sure you have all the needed translations: <pre class="tt">perl check_translation.pl French</pre> Create a <a href="https://github.com/craigk5n/webcalendar/pulls" target="_blank">pull request on Github</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>During Import, I receive this error: Unknown Timezone: XXXXX defaulting to GMT.</dt>
      <dd>This is a notice that your import file contained unknown timezone information. WebCalendar will simply save the event or task as GMT. You are encouraged to submit these notices as a new <a href="https://github.com/craigk5n/webcalendar/issues" target="_blank">Issue on Github</a>, so that WebCalendar can improve its TZID support.</dd>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <dl>
<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Troubleshooting -->
      <dt>I get error messages about undefined variables when I try to view any page.</dt>
      <dd>On newer versions of PHP, the default setting of PHP is to display messages when an undefined variable is referenced. To prevent these messages from being displayed, change the setting of <span class="tt">error_reporting</span> in your <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file to be: <pre>error_reporting = E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE</pre> Alternately, you can disable any error messages from being displayed in the browser and have them logged to a file. (See the comments included in the <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file for instructions on how to do this.)</dd>
      <dt><a id="dbCacheError">I receive an error message saying "Error removing temporary file" or "Cache error".</a></dt>
      <dd>This indicates that a file in your database cache directory could not be deleted or created. The quickest solution to this problem is to not use the database cache. Simply remote the <span class="tt">db_cachedir</span> line from <span class="tt">includes/settings.php</span> with a simple text editor. This error is most common when the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script is run from a cron job under a different system account than the PHP application server is running under. This causes files created by the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script to be owned by a different user than normal, preventing the PHP application from being able to remove the files when needed.</dd>
      <dt>I receive an error message saying "Failed opening 'includes/...' for inclusion ..."</dt>
      <dd>You may have to modify the <span class="tt">include_path</span> setting in your <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file. Most users do not need to do this, but some PHP installs seem to require it. You will need to add the WebCalendar directory to the list of directories for <span class="tt">include_path</span>.</dd>
      <dt>I get an error message from PHP saying "Call to undefined function: ..."</dt>
      <dd>This tells you that your version of PHP is missing something that WebCalendar needs. If the function mentioned is a database login function (<em>ociplogin, mysql_pconnect, ibase_connect, pg_pconnect</em>), then you probably do not have the needed support for your database compiled into PHP. If the function is not a database connect call, then check the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/" title="Open in new window" target="_blank">PHP manual</a> to see if the function requires a specific version of PHP. You may have an out-dated version of PHP that requires upgrading.</dd>
      <dt>When I try and view certain pages, nothing happens for 30 seconds, then I get a time-out error.</dt>
      <dd>On slower or very busy servers, it can take some time for the server to get all the events. Most PHP installations have a built-in timeout out of 30 seconds and will interrupt any request that takes longer than that. This is most likely to happen on the year-long custom report or on the month view when layers are being used. If you have access, you can increase the time-out value for PHP in the <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file by changing the setting of the <span class="tt">max_execution_time</span> setting.</dd>
      <dt>I get an error message that says "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'."</dt>
      <dd>This is a PHP/MySQL configuration issue. The value of <span class="tt">mysql.default_socket</span> in your <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file must match the value of <span class="tt">socket</span> in your <span class="tt">my.cnf</span> file. Edit the <span class="tt">php.ini</span> file to fix this problem.</dd>
      <dt>I am not receiving any email messages from WebCalendar.</dt>
      <dd>WebCalendar sends two types of email messages: Notifications<a href="#g_notification">*</a> and Reminders<a href="#g_reminder">*</a>. Check the following if you are not receiving any email:
        <ol>
          <li>You have defined a valid SMTP server in your PHP configuration file <span class="tt">php.ini</span>. (The setting is "SMTP" in the "mail_function" section.)</li>
          <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, you have set the "Email Enabled" setting to "Yes".</li>
          <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, make sure you have the "Default sender address" to something.<br><span class="note">Note:</span> Some mail system will reject mail that has a "From" address that is a different domain from the originating SMTP server. So, if your SMTP server is smtp.mydomain.com and your "Default sender address" is calendar@someotherdomain.com, some mail systems may bounce the mail back.</li>
          <li>For a Notification, make sure you have the type of Notification set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
          <li>For a Reminder:
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure you have "Event reminders" set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
              <li>Make sure you have <a href="#reminders">setup a cron job</a> to periodically run the <span class="tt">send_reminders.php</span> script.</li>

    <h2>Appendix A: Using phpMyAdmin</h2>
    <p>If you have <a href="http://phpmyadmin.net" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> installed and configured to manage your MySQL database, use the following steps to setup WebCalendar. (The following information is based on phpMyAdmin version 2.6.1.)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the initial phpMyAdmin page, under the "MySQL" heading, the first option should be "Create new database." Enter the name you have chosen for the database and press the "Create" button. (The default database name used by WebCalendar is "intranet".) After pressing the "Create" button, it should say: "Database &lt;your database name here&gt; has been created."</li>
      <li>Click on the home icon (the small house) in the left-side navigation. This will bring you back to your phpMyAdmin home page.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Create new MySQL user. If you already have a MySQL login that you would like to use, you can skip this step.</li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the "Privileges" link under the "MySQL" heading.</li>
          <li>Below any existing users listed, click on the link "Add a new User."</li>
          <li>Fill in the details of your new database user. The default username for WebCalendar is "webcalendar" with a password of "webcal01". Leave the "Host" field set to "Any host".</li>
          <li>From the list of "Global privileges", be sure to select: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FILE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX, DROP</li>
          <li>Click on the "Go" button.</li>
          <li>You should see a page that says "You have added a new user."</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
      <li>Click on the "Databases" tab at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>From the list of databases on the page, click on the name of the database that you created.</li>
      <li>Click on the "SQL" tab at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>At the bottom of the page, there is an area to upload a SQL file. Click on the "Browse" button and select the <span class="tt">tables-mysql.sql</span> file in the WebCalendar toplevel directory. Then, press the "Go" button.</li>
      <li>The top of the page should say "Your SQL-query has been executed successfully."</li>
      <li>You have now finished creating the WebCalendar database tables.</li>
    </ol>
    <a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a>
    <hr>
    <a id="appendixB"></a>
    <h2>Appendix B: Database Setup</h2>
    <p>There are three steps in setting up the database:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating the database</li>
      <li>Creating the user</li>
      <li>Creating the required tables</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are SQL files provided for each of the supported databases. These files are typically used during the web-based installation process. However, you can also manually populate your database using the files which can be found in the <span class="tt">install/sql</span> directory. Most of the commands below assume you are starting from this directory so that the SQL files (e.g. <span class="tt">tables-oracle.sql</span>) are in your current directory.</p>
    <p>Follow the steps outlined below for the database you are using. When complete, a single user account will be created with the <strong>login "admin" and password "admin"</strong>, which you are encouraged to use to create your own account.</p>
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> In the examples below, text in <strong>bold</strong> represents text that you must type in.</p>
    <p><span class="note">Security:</span> The default values for database, login, and password (<strong>intranet</strong>, <strong>webcalendar</strong>, and <strong>webcal01</strong>) are for demonstration purposes only and should never be used in a production environment.</p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">MySQL</h3>
    <p>The following will create a database named "intranet".<pre class="b">>mysqladmin create intranet</pre></p>
    <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.
      <pre><strong>mysql --user=root mysql</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO webcalendar@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'webcal01' WITH GRANT OPTION;</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>QUIT</strong>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>If you will be accessing MySQL from a different machine than the one running the web server, repeat the command above and replace 'localhost' with the hostname of the other machine.</p>
    <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <span class="tt">tables-mysql.sql</span> file:<pre class="b">mysql intranet &lt; tables-mysql.sql</pre></p>
    <p>In the above example, "intranet" is the name of your database.</p>
    <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you are using <a href="http://phpmyadmin.net" target="_blank">phpMyAdmin</a> to manage your MySQL database, follow the instructions in <a href="#appendixA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">Oracle</h3>
    <p>The following will create a tablespace named "webcalendar". From the command line, startup sqlplus and issue the following command:
      <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE TABLESPACE webcalendar
DATAFILE 'webcalendar.dat' SIZE 10M
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE 40M;</strong>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.
      <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE USER webcalendar IDENTIFIED BY webcal01 DEFAULT TABLESPACE webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>GRANT dba TO webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <span class="tt">tables-oracle.sql</span> file:
      <pre><strong>sqlplus webcalendar/webcal01</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>@tables-oracle;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">PostgreSQL</h3>
    <p>The following will create a database named "webcalendar". From the command line as the psql user: issue the following commands:
      <pre>$ <strong>su postgres</strong>
# <strong>createdb webcalendar</strong>
# <strong>createuser --no-createdb --no-adduser -P webcalendar</strong>
# <strong>psql webcalendar webcalendar
\i tables-postgres.sql
\q</strong>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">Interbase</h3>
    <p>The following will create a database named "WEBCAL.gdb". From the command line, startup usql and issue the following command:<pre class="b">>CREATE DATABASE 'WEBCAL.gdb';</pre></p>
    <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <span class="tt">tables-ibase.sql</span> file:
      <pre class="b">isql
connect /path/WEBCAL.gdb;
input path/table-ibase.sql;
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">ODBC</h3>
    <p>Setup will depend on which database you are using. When it comes time to create the tables, the <span class="tt">tables-postgres.sql</span> file should work for most databases.</p>
    <h3 class="colorheader">Microsoft SQL Server</h3>
    <p>Create a database, <strong>intranet,</strong> and add a user, <strong>webcalendar</strong>, to access this database. The user should be granted public, db_datareader, and db_datawriter privileges. Open SQL Query Analyzer then open the file <span class="tt">tables-mssql.sql</span>. Make sure you have identified <strong>intranet</strong> as the target database and Execute the contents of the sql file.</p>

    <h2>Appendix C: Setting Up Reminders on Windows</h2>
    <p>You have two options to choose from when setting up email reminders on a Windows platform. You can either install a cron package for Windows, or you can use the Windows Task Scheduler.</p>
    <h3>Installing a Cron Package</h3>
    <p>If you install a cron package for Windows, you will need to setup to setup a cron job. (UNIX cron is a tool for used to run tasks as specified times anywhere from every minute to once a year.)</p>
    <p>First, you should create a <span class="tt">sendreminders.bat</span> file that contains a single line:<pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre></p>
    <p>You can place this <span class="tt">sendreminders.bat</span> file anywhere on your file system.</p>
    <p>Next, you need to setup the cron job. The crontab entry should look like the following (replace with the correct path to your newly created <span class="tt">sendreminders.bat</span> file):<pre>1 * * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre></p>
    <p>The "1 * * * *" will tell the cron schedule to run this task at 1 after the hour all day long (12:01am, 1:01am, 2:01am, etc.) If you only want to run it once per day, you could use:<pre>1 4 * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre></p>
    <p>This would tell the cron scheduler to run the task at 4:01am every day. For more information about the syntax of cron, check the documentation for the package you have installed.
<!-- [bad link]
       or view the UNIX man page for crontab
       (like <a href="http://rt.com/man/crontab.5.html"
       target="_blank">this one</a>).
 -->
    </p>
    <p>There are many cron packages for Windows available. Try searching Github for one this is currently maintained.</p>
    <h3>Using the Windows Task Schedule</h3>
    <p>Follow the steps listed below to setup a new task in the Windows Task Scheduler. (These instructions were created with Windows XP Professional. Other versions of Windows might be different.)</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new batch file called <span class="tt">sendreminders.bat</span>. The contents of this file should be a single line: <pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre></li>
      <li>On Windows XP, go to Control Panel</li>
      <li>Double-click on "Scheduled Tasks." This brings up a window that says "Scheduled Task Wizard"</li>
      <li>Click on "Browse..."</li>
      <li>Select the location of your newly created <span class="tt">sendreminders.bat</span> file.</li>
      <li>Click on "Open"</li>
      <li>Change the name of the task. "WebCalendar Reminders" is a good name.</li>
      <li>Select how often to perform this task. Select "Daily."</li>
      <li>Click on "Next"</li>
      <li>Select the start time, then click "Next". If you are planning on sending out reminders throughout the day, pick a time shortly after midnight.</li>
      <li> Enter your user password as required. Click on "Next."</li>
      <li> Select the checkbox "Open advanced properties".</li>
      <li> Click on "Finish."</li>
      <li> Under the "Schedule" tab, click on "Advanced."</li>
      <li> Click on "Repeat Task" and fill in the details of how often the job should run. For example, you can set it to run "every 15 minutes", then click on "until" and set that time to 11:30pm.</li>

        <td>The login of the calendar to display upcoming events for. If you want to see upcoming events for user login "joe", then you would change this to "joe".<br>Default setting: __public__ (The public calendar)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="vtop">$allow_user_override</td>
        <td>Specifies whether the calendar user can be specified in the URL (in which case the $username setting will be ignored) using a URL like "upcoming.php?user=joe".<br>Default setting: true</td>

    <h2>Appendix E: How To Configure for LDAP</h2>
    <p>Configuring WebCalendar to use an existing LDAP directory is fairly simple. It is know to work with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory and should work with other systems as well.<br><span class="note">Note:</span> If you use LDAP, the group functionality of WebCalendar does not yet work.</p>
    <p>To configure WebCalendar to use LDAP, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Verify that your PHP install supports LDAP.</li>
      <li>Configure <span class="tt">settings.php</span></li>
      <li>Configure <span class="tt">includes/user-ldap.php</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The first step is to verify that your install of PHP supports LDAP. The simplest way to do this is to view the output of <code>phpinfo()</code>. If you can't easily call phpinfo() from another page, consider pasting the following into a new page (e.g. <span class="tt">phpinfo.php</span>):
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;PHP Info page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;?php
      phpinfo()
    ?&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>When you load the page in your browser, the resulting output will begin with general PHP information and then include an alphabetical list of enabled PHP modules. If you aren't sure where to put the file so you can load it via your web server, place it in the webcalendar directory and add &quot;phpinfo.php&quot; to the URL for your webcalendar install. If your PHP supports LDAP, it will be listed as a module and version information will be given. If &quot;ldap&quot; is not listed anywhere in the output of <span class="tt">phpinfo()</span>, then your PHP install does not support LDAP. You may need to install additional packages, depending on your OS and version; under Debian Linux, for example, the &quot;php4&quot; package does not include support but, &quot;php4-ldap&quot; does.</p>
    <p>The second step is to set WebCalendar to use LDAP authentication in <span class="tt">settings.php</span>. Instructions on to do this can be found in the <a href="#appsetup">Application Installation</a> section above. In summary, the following should be set:<br><span class="tt">use_http_auth = false</span><br><span class="tt">user_inc = user-ldap.php</span></p>
    <p>The next step is a little more work and involves editing the <span class="tt">includes/user-ldap.php</span> file with a text editor. You will have to set several configuration variables. If you don't know what to set the variables to, consult your LDAP system administrator. Documentation exists for all variables in the file. Finally, users have gotten LDAP working with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory by just changing the following:</p>
    <table style="margin-inline: 20px; border:0">
      <tr>
        <td class="vtop">$ldap_server</td>
        <td>FQDN or IP address of the LDAP server (or localhost).<br>ex. 'ldapserver.company.com'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="vtop">$ldap_base_dn</td>
        <td>Specifies the base DN used to search for users<br>ex. 'ou=people,dc=company,dc=com' or 'o=context,ou=subcontext'</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="vtop">$ldap_admin_group_name</td>
        <td>Specifies a group (complete DN) with admin rights for WebCalendar<br>You might have to create one in LDAP<br>ex. 'cn=it,ou=group,dc=company,dc=com'</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Using SSL with LDAP</h3>
    <p>If the LDAP server will accept connections over SSL, simply add 'ldaps://' to the beginning of <span class="tt">$ldap_server</span>.<br>Example: ldaps://ldapserver.company.com</p>
    <h3>Using TLS with LDAP</h3>
    <p>If the LDAP server is set up to use TLS, set <span class="tt">$ldap_start_tls = true</span>.</p>
    <h3>Using LDAPv3</h3>
    <p>If the LDAP server uses protocol version 3, set <span class="tt">$set_ldap_version = true</span> and <span class="tt">$ldap_version = '3'</span>.</p>
