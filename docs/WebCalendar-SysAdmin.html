<a name="requirements"></a>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>PHP 4 (PHP 5 not yet tested) with <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> enabled</li>
  <li>Database (see <a href="#database">below</a>)</li>
  <li>CSS-enabled browser</li>
  <li>JavaScript-enabled browser</li>
  <li>If not using HTTP-based authentication, then browser cookies are required</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li>pilot-link (if exporting to Palm):
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158">http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>
 </ul>
 <p><a name="database">You must have one of the following databases installed</a>:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Oracle 8</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Interbase</li>
  <li>MS SQL Server</li>
  <li>ODBC (PHP ODBC includes support for Adabas D, IBM DB2, Solid and Sybase SQL Anywhere as well as ODBC)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>For the database you choose, you must have its drivers built into
  PHP.  For example, to use MySQL, PHP must be compiled with MySQL
  support (which is the default setting when installing PHP).
  See the PHP pages (<a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.php.net" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>)
  for more information on setting up PHP.</p>
 <p>No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
  application.  However, PHP shoud be compiled with <tt>--enable-track-vars</tt>
  on some systems.</p>
 <p>Make sure that <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> in <tt>php.ini</tt>
  is turned on (otherwise, you will get an error message when you try to access WebCalendar.)</p>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> If you are using Apache
  as your web server and if you cannot or do not want to enable
  <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> for your entire site, you can enable
  it just for WebCalendar.
  Create a <tt>.htaccess</tt> file in the toplevel WebCalendar
  directory that contains a single line:</p>
  <pre>php_value magic_quotes_gpc 1</pre>
  <p>(For this to work with Apache, you must have the Apache
  <tt>AllowOverride All</tt> directive enabled for the directory
  where WebCalendar is installed.
  Additionally, PHP must be running as an Apache module, not
  a CGI.)</p>

 <p>You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
  performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
  deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
  database connection pooling.  Additionally, this application can use
  a form/cookie-based authentication or traditional HTTP authentication.
  For traditional HTTP authentication, PHP must be built as an Apache
  module.</p>
 <p>If you are planning on using email reminders, you will need to build
  PHP as a CGI in order to run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script.  I would
  strongly recommend building a module-based PHP for your web server
  and then a second PHP build to create the CGI version.</p>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> Some Linux distributions come with both a module-based PHP
  with Apache and a standalone PHP binary.
  Check for <tt>/usr/bin/php</tt> to see if you already have the
  PHP standalone executable.  If it's there, you can use
  the following command to see what version of PHP you have:</p>
 <pre>/usr/bin/php -v</pre>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="fileunpacking"></a>
<h2>File Unpacking</h2>
 <p>Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
  your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)</p>
 <p>By default, WebCalendar should create its own directory
  when you unpack it.  The new directory name will typically
  contain the version name (such as <tt>WebCalendar-0.9.41</tt>).
  You can rename this directory after unpacking the files if you
  prefer a directory name like <tt>calendar</tt> or <tt>webcalendar</tt>.
  Keep in mind that unless you remap the directory (via your web server's
  configuration settings), it will be part of the URL for the calendar.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="dbsetup"></a>
 <h2>Database Setup</h2>
 <p>There are three steps in setting up the database:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Creating the database</li>
  <li>Creating the user</li>
  <li>Creating the required tables</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Follow the steps outlined below for the database you are using.
  When complete, a single user account will be created
  with the <strong>login "admin" and password "admin"</strong>, which you are encouraged
  to use to create your own account.</p>
 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> In the examples below, text in <strong>bold</strong>
  represents text that you must type in.</p>
         <p><span class="note">Security:</span> The default values for database, login, and
  password (<strong>intranet</strong>, <strong>webcalendar</strong>, and <strong>webcal01</strong>) are for demonstration purposes only
  and should never be used in a production environment.</p>
 <h3 class="colorheader">MySQL</h3>
 <p>The following will create a database named "intranet".</p>
<pre><strong>mysqladmin create intranet</strong></pre>
 <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.</p>
 <pre><strong>mysql --user=root mysql</strong>
mysql> <strong>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO webcalendar@localhost
IDENTIFIED BY 'webcal01' WITH GRANT OPTION;</strong>
mysql> <strong>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</strong>
mysql> <strong>QUIT</strong></pre>
 <p>If you will be accessing MySQL from a different machine than
  the one running the web server, repeat the command above
  and replace 'localhost' with the hostname of the other machine.</p>
 <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt> file:</p>
 <pre><strong>mysql intranet &lt; tables-mysql.sql</strong></pre>
 <p>In the above example, "intranet" is the name of your database.</p>

 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you are using
 <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a> to
 manage your MySQL database, follow the
 instructions in <a href="#appendixA">Appendix A</a>.
 </p>

 <h3 class="colorheader">Oracle</h3>
 <p>The following will create a tablespace named "webcalendar".
  From the command line, startup sqlplus and
  issue the following command:</p>
 <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE TABLESPACE webcalendar
DATAFILE 'webcalendar.dat' SIZE 10M
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE 40M;</strong></pre>
 <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.</p>
 <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE USER webcalendar IDENTIFIED BY webcal01
DEFAULT TABLESPACE webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>GRANT dba TO webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong></pre>
 <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <tt>tables-oracle.sql</tt> file:</p>
 <pre><strong>sqlplus webcalendar/webcal01</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>@tables-oracle;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong></pre>

 <h3 class="colorheader">PostgreSQL</h3>
 <p>The following will create a database named "webcalendar".
  From the command line, startup psql and
  issue the following command:</p>
 <pre><strong>create database webcalendar;
\c webcalendar
\i tables-postgres.sql
\q</strong></pre>

 <h3 class="colorheader">Interbase</h3>
 <p>The following will create a database named "WEBCAL.gdb".
  From the command line, startup usql and
  issue the following command:</p>
 <pre><strong>CREATE DATABASE 'WEBCAL.gdb';</strong></pre>

 <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <tt>tables-ibase.sql</tt> file:</p>
 <pre><strong>isql
connect /path/WEBCAL.gdb;
input path/table-ibase.sql;</strong></pre>

 <h3 class="colorheader">ODBC</h3>
 <p>Setup will depend on which database you are using.
  When it comes time to create the tables,
  the <tt>tables-postgres.sql</tt> file should work for most
  databases.</p>
   <h3 class="colorheader">MSSQL</h3>
 <p>Create a database, <strong>intranet,</strong>  and add a user, <strong>webcalendar</strong>, to access this database. The user should be granted public, db_datareader,
   and db_datawriter privileges. Open SQL Query Analyzer then open
   the file <tt>tables-postgres.sql</tt>. Make sure you have identified <strong>intranet</strong> as the target database and Execute the contents of the sql file.</p>
          <div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="appsetup"></a>
 <h2>Application Setup</h2>
 <p>Next, you will need to run the web-based database setup script
 (simply direct your browser to your new WebCalendar location).
 You will need to modify the permissions of the <tt>includes</tt>
 directory.  On Linux/UNIX, you should change this directory
 to be read/write for all users (<tt>chmod 777 includes</tt>).
 On Windows, change this directory to have full access for all users
 using Windows Explorer. Changing the write permissions will allow the web-based
 database configuration tool to create the <tt>settings.php</tt> file.</p>
 
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> After you have created the
 <tt>settings.php</tt> file (with the "Save Settings" button),
 you can change the permissions back to a more restrictive setting.</p>
 
 <p>After you test and save your database settings, you
 will be prompted to enter an installation password.
 <b>Write this password down somewhere.</b> There is no way to reset 
 this password. If you forget this password and need to change your database settings, 
 you will need to manually edit the <tt>settings.php</tt> file with a text editor.</p>
 
 <p>If you choose not to use the web-based database configuration
 tool, you can manually edit the <tt>settings.php</tt> file.
 There is an example file <tt>settings.php.orig</tt> that you
 can use as a starting point. Simply rename this file to <tt>settings.php</tt>. 
 You will need to set the values as follows in <tt>settings.php</tt>:</p>
 <p>To configure your database access. Set the values for:</p>
 <table class="distinguish">
  <tr><td>
   db_type</td>
  <td>
   One of "mysql", "oracle", "postgresql", "odbc",
   &quot;mssql&quot;,
   or "ibase"
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
   db_host</td><td>
   The hostname that database is running on.
   (Use localhost if it's the same machine as 
   the web server.) (This variable is not used with ODBC)
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   db_login</td><td>
   The database login
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   db_password</td><td>
   The database password for the above login
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   db_database</td><td>
   The name of the database that the calendar 
   tables reside in.  ("intranet" in the <a href="#dbsetup">examples above</a>.) 
   For ODBC, this should be the DSN.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   db_persistent</td><td>
   Enable use of persistent (pooled) database connections. 
   This should typically be enabled.
  </td></tr>
 </table>

 <p>You can configure the calendar to run in single-user<a href="#g_singleuser">*</a> mode or 
 multi-user<a href="#g_multiuser">*</a> mode. If this is your first time using the 
 calendar, it's easier to try single-user. You can always switch to multi-user 
 later. Leave <tt>single_user</tt> set to "N" (the default) for multi-user or set 
 it to "Y" and set the value of <tt>single_user_login</tt> to a login name of your liking 
 to set the system to single-user mode. (And be sure to set the value of 
 <tt>single_user_login</tt> to the login that you would choose if you decide to switch 
 to multi-user mode some day.)</p>
 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode,
  make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the
  <tt>single_user_login</tt> variable to.  You will need to do this via the
  database (mysql, sqlplus, etc.)  Look in the <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt>
  (or <tt>tables-oracle.sql</tt>, etc.) to see the example of adding in the "admin" user.</p>
 <p>If you are setting up a multi-user calendar, you will need to choose
  how your users are authenticated. You must change the settings of 
  <tt>use_http_auth</tt> and <tt>user_inc</tt>
  to setup which authentication method to use.</p>
 <p>You currently have four choices:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Web-based authentication (login/passwords verified in the WebCalendar database):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user.php</tt>
  </li>
  <li>HTTP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by the web server):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = true</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user.php</tt><br />
   ... and don't forget to setup your web server to handle user
   authentication.<br />
          <span class="note">Note:</span> In order to use HTTP-based authentication,
    PHP must be setup as a module for your server rather than a CGI.
  </li>
  <li>NIS-based authentication (login/passwords verified by NIS):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user-nis.php</tt><br />
   Additional configuration settings will need to be set
   in <tt>includes/user-nis.php</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>LDAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by LDAP server):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user-ldap.php</tt><br />
   Additional configuration settings will need to be set
   in <tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt>.
  </li>
 </ol>
    <p>Keep in mind that if you want to use reminders, you will need to
  setup the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script (see below) and keep your admin
  setting for "Email enabled" set to "Yes" on the admin settings page.</p>
    <p>At this point, your WebCalendar installation should be up and running.
  To access WebCalendar open up your favorite web browser and
  type in the URL.  The URL will depend on where you installed
  WebCalendar.</p>
    <p>When you unpacked/unzipped the WebCalendar distribution, it typically
  creates a directory that includes the version number.
  For example, if the zip file was named <tt>WebCalendar-0.9.99.zip</tt>
  (or <tt>WebCalendar-0.9.99.tar.gz</tt>), then there
  should be a <tt>WebCalendar-0.9.99</tt> directory.  For convenience, you
  can rename this directory so that the URL does not include the version
  number.  On Windows, you can do this from the Windows Explorer.
  On Linux/UNIX, you can use the <tt>mv</tt> command to rename the directory.
  Supposing you renamed the <tt>WebCalendar-0.9.99</tt> directory to just
  be <tt>calendar</tt>, and you unpacked/unzipped the files into your toplevel
  web server directory, the URL would be:</p>
    <pre>http://yourserverhere/calendar/index.php</pre>
 <p>If you have not previously configured your database settings,
  you will be automatically redirected to a web page for
  configuring your database settings. After you have configured the database, 
  use the URL again to access WebCalendar.</p>
    <p>If you have configured your web server to use <tt>index.php</tt> as the
  default index page for a directory, you can omit that from the URL.
  On a single-user system, your browser should be redirected to week.php
  initially. On a multi-user system, your browser should be redirected to login.php
  so that you can login.</p>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> On a multi-user system, the only user account created
 during installation has the username of "admin" and a password of "admin". You should create 
 a new admin account and delete this one for security reasons.</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="users"></a>
 <h2>Creating Users</h2>
 <p>After logging in as an admin user (the initial username is "admin" with
  password "admin"), you will see a common set of links at the bottom
  of each page.  Follow these steps to create a new user:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Login to WebCalendar as an admin user</li>
  <li>Click on the "Admin" link at the bottom of any WebCalendar page</li>
  <li>Click on the "Users" button</li>
  <li>Click on the "Add New User" link</li>
  <li>Fill out the form with details for the new user (email address is optional)</li>
  <li>Click on the "Save" button</li>
 </ol>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> On a single-user system, you do not need to create any users.</p>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> For an event calendar, you do not need to create a user for the "public user".</p>
<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="reminders"></a>
 <h2>Setting Up Email Reminders</h2>
 <p>PHP does not come with a utility for executing time-based jobs.
  So, in order to check periodically for email reminders, a shell
  script was written in PHP.  You will need two things to get this working:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>You should have a version of PHP built as a CGI (so that you can run
    php from the command line).  This does not mean you must build all
    of PHP as a CGI.  You can still build PHP as a module for your web
  server and then build the CGI-based PHP later.<br />
    <span class="note">Note:</span> Many Linux distributions and some Windows LAMP packages
    come with the PHP built for CGI.</li>
  <li>You must setup cron (on Linux/UNIX) or something like cron for Windows
  to run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script periodically.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Building PHP as a CGI is outside the scope of these instructions.  But,
  if you read the PHP instructions, you'll see that the default build
  settings will build the CGI-based PHP.  If you really can't do this
  (perhaps you don't have permission to install anything new on the
  system), skip down a couple of paragraphs to an alternate solution
  that does not require PHP CGI.</p>
 <p>For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of
  a user.  (This would be the same user that the web server
  process runs as.)</p>
 <pre><tt>1 * * * * cd /some/directory/webcalendar/tools; ./send_reminders.php</tt></pre>
    <p>Of course, replace the directory location to wherever the
  <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> file can be found.  If you moved this out of the
  tools directory (which is recommended for security reasons),
  be sure to update <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> since it needs
  to know where to find other WebCalendar files.</p>
    <p>If you cannot setup PHP as a CGI or have no idea how, you can leave
  <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> in its current location and access it via a URL.
  IMHO, this is not the best choice, but it still works.  Setup a cron
  job to access the URL.  For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to
  the crontab entry of a user.</p>
 <pre><tt>1 * * * * wget http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php &gt; /dev/null</tt></pre>
  <p>You should test this from the command line first to make sure your setup is

 <h2>Custom Event Fields</h2>
 <p>You may want to customize the event-specific fields found in
  the <tt>includes/site_extras.php</tt> field.
  If this is your first time using the calendar, you can skip
  this step and come back later since this step
  is <i>optional</i>.</p>
 <p>You can use this feature to add extra
  fields to your calendar events.  For example, you can add a URL,
  a contact email address, or a location.</p>
 <p>By default, this file is configured with
  a single reminder field that allows the user to specify how long
  before the event the reminder should be sent.</p>
 <p><span class="tip">TIP</span> See <a href="#reminders">instructions</a> on setting
  up reminders to enable sending of reminders.</p>
 <p>When defining a new custom field, the following types listed below

 <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
 <dl>
<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Installation/Setup -->
  <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on Windows?</dt>
   <dd>The easiest way to do this is to try one of the prepackaged bundles that will install all of these for you:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.foxserv.net/">FoxServ</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxserv.net" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>

    </ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on UNIX/Linux?</dt>
  <dd>There are many online instructions on how to do this. Here are a few:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2000/11/17/php_admin.html">ONLamp.com: Basic Installtion of PHP on a Unix System</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2000/11/17/php_admin.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>

    </ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>I've finished the install.  What is the login to WebCalendar?</dt>
  <dd>After the initial creation of the database tables, there will
    be a single user account created with the username "admin" and
    the password set to "admin" as well.
    <br /><span class="note">Note:</span> This account is intended to get your started.
    You should create a new admin account and delete this one.</dd>
 <dt><a name="samplepublic">I want to use WebCalendar as an events calendar for
    my organization.  How do I set it up to do this?</a></dt>
  <dd>You will want to setup WebCalendar to use public access.
    <ol>
    <li>Setup your <tt>settings.php</tt> file as a multi-user
      system (see <a href="#appsetup">instructions</a>).</li>
    <li>In System Settings, set "Allow public access" to "Yes."</li>
    <li>If you want people to be able to submit new events
      through public access, set "Public access can add events"
      to "Yes."</li>
    <li>If you set "Public access can add events" to "Yes",
      set the setting for "Public access new events
      require approval" to your liking.  If you set this to "Yes,"
      an admin user will need to approve any new events before
      they will appear on the public access calendar.</li>
    <li>Login using one of the accounts you have setup.
       Add a new event, and select "Public User" as one of the
       participants.</li>
    <li>If you have enabled "Require event approvals" in your
       System Settings, then you will need to approve the new
       event.  Choose the "Unapproved Events" at the bottom
       of any page (you must be an admin user to access this).
       You will be presented with a list of unapproved events
       (for both the current user and for the Public User account).
       Approve the new event for the Public User.</li>
    <li>Go to the Login page.  You will see a "Access public calendar"
       link that will bring you to the calendar for public access.</li>
    <li>By default, the index.php page should send users to
       the public calendar.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

 <dt>How can I add holidays to the calendar?</dt>
 <dd>There is no built-in support for holidays because it is
 not necessary.  You can add holidays into WebCalendar by importing
 one of the many iCal holiday files that are freely available.
 A good resource for free iCal files is
 <a href="http://www.icalshare.com">iCalShare
        <img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>.
 For example, the U.S. holiday ics file can be downloaded from:
 <blockquote>
 <a href="http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521">http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521
        <img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>
 </blockquote>
 If you don't want each individual user to have to import
 the holiday calendar, you can use nonuser calendars.
 First, make sure nonuser calendars are enabled in your
 system settings.  Then, from Admin->Users, you can
 access nonuser calendars.  Create a new nonuser calendar
 (such as "usholidays").  Then, notify your users that they
 can add this nonuser calendar as a layer to their own
 calendar in order to see the holidays.
 </dd>

 <dt>Why are deleted events still present in the database?</dt>
  <dd>When you delete an event from your calendar, it is not
    deleted from the database.  Instead, it is marked as deleted.
    This allows the system administrator access to information
    even after it is deleted.</dd>
 <dt>Can I setup more than one public calendar?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot directly setup two public calendars. However,
    there are two options for emulating this type of functionality:
    <ul>
    <li>You can <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#categories">create global categories</a> and point users to the calendar with only a certain category displayed.</li>
    <li>You can setup multiple NonUser calendars and enable
        public access viewing of other users' calendars.
        You can then link directly to the calendar of one of
        the NonUser calendars, or you can 
        <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#views">setup a view</a>
        that contains the calendar of one or more of the NonUser calendars.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
 <dt>How do I change the title "Public Access" at the top of
 the calendar?</dt>
  <dd>In the file <tt>translations/English-US.txt</tt>,
  change the line that says "Public Access" to what you want
  it to say on the right side.<br/><br/>Example: 
  <pre>Public Access: Foobar Event Calendar</pre>
  </dd>
 <dt>Can I embed WebCalendar as a component on another web page?</dt>
  <dd>WebCalendar is meant to be run as a standalone web application.
    You can customize the appearance of WebCalendar to match your existing
    site.
    To do this, In System Settings, set both "Custom header" and
  "Custom trailer" to "Yes" and press the "Edit" button to enter the
    header and trailer content.
    <br />
    If you are looking to just include a list of upcoming events in one
    of your web pages, you can use the <tt>upcoming.php</tt> page in
    WebCalendar to do this.  Edit the top of this file to configure options.
    (These settings will likely move into System Settings in subsequent release.)
    You can then use an <tt>iframe</tt> elsewhere on your web site as
    in the example below:
    <pre>&lt;iframe height="250" width="300" scrolling="yes" src="upcoming.php">&lt;/iframe></pre>
    Include this HTML anywhere on any of your pages.
    By default, the events from the public calendar will be loaded (so
    you must have "Public Access" enabled in System Settings).
    You can override this with another user's calendar.
    (See <tt>upcoming.php</tt> for instructions on this.)
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I add a new translation?</dt>
  <dd>
  It's a fairly simple process.  If you've ever translated a C-based app
     that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem.  The I18N
     support was based on GNU's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">gettext</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>.  Here's what you need to do.
     <ol>
     <li>look in the "translations" directory</li>
     <li>copy the <tt>English-US.txt</tt> file into what you'd like to call your
       language data file.  (e.g. <tt>cp English-US.txt French.txt</tt>)</li>
     <li>Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ":" into the
       new language.  Do <i>not</i> alter the text to the left of the ":".</li>
     <li>When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
       Run the <tt>check_translation.pl</tt> script on your new data file to make
       sure you have all the needed translations.
       (e.g. <tt>perl check_translation.pl French</tt>)</li>
     <li>Add the new language to both the $languages array and the
       $browser_languages arrays defined in <tt>includes/config.php</tt>.</li>
     <li>Test it out... </li>
  <li>Post a copy of your translation (along with your changes to <tt>includes/config.php</tt>) to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870">SourceForge Patches</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> for WebCalendar.</li>
     </ol>
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I update an existing translation?</dt>
  <dd>Just open up the translation file in the <tt>translations</tt> directory
     with your favorite text editor (like vi, vim, emacs, pico, Notepad, etc.).
     In particular look for places where missing translations are indicated.
     All missing translations should be marked with a
  "&lt;&lt;&nbsp;MISSING&nbsp;>>" note.
  and typically the English version of the translation will also be included on the following line (as in the example below):
    <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING >>
# Edit:
#</pre><br />
  For some text, an abberviation may be used rather than the English text.
  In those cases, the full text will be noted as in the following example:
  <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING >>
# custom-script-help:
# English text: Allows entry of custom Javascript or stylesheet text that
# will be inserted into the HTML "head" section of every page.
#</pre><br />
     When you're done making changes, move into the <tt>tools</tt> directory.
       Run the <tt>check_translation.pl</tt> script on your new data file to make
       sure you have all the needed translations:
  <pre><tt>perl check_translation.pl French</tt></pre>
     Post a copy of your translation to the 
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870">SourceForge Patches</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> for WebCalendar.</dd>

<!-- START FAQ: Troubleshooting -->
 <dt>I get error messages about undefined variables when I try to view any page.</dt>
  <dd>On newer versions of PHP, the default setting of PHP is to display
    messages when an undefined variable is referenced.  To prevent
    these messages from being displayed, change the setting of <tt>error_reporting</tt>
    in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file to be:
    <pre>error_reporting = E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE</pre>
    Alternately, you can disable any error messages from being displayed
    in the browser and have them logged to a file.  (See the comments
    included in the <tt>php.ini</tt> file for instructions on how to do this.)</dd>
 <dt>I get errors when trying to add an event that contains a single quotation.</dt>
  <dd>WebCalendar is designed to work with PHP's
  <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> feature (configured in <tt>php.ini</tt>).
  If you do not have this enabled (<tt>On</tt> in <tt>php.ini</tt>),
  you may get errors when adding events.
  In WebCalendar version 0.9.43 or later, you will always get an error
  message telling you to update <tt>php.ini</tt> if <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt>
  is set to <tt>Off</tt>.
  <br/><br/>
  <span class="tip">TIP</span> If you are using Apache
  as your web server and if you cannot or do not want to enable
  <tt>magic_quotes_gpc</tt> for your entire site, you can enable
  it just for WebCalendar.
  Create a <tt>.htaccess</tt> file in the toplevel WebCalendar
  directory that contains a single line:
  <pre>php_value magic_quotes_gpc 1</pre>
  <p>(For this to work with Apache, you must have the Apache
  <tt>AllowOverride All</tt> directive enabled for the directory
  where WebCalendar is installed.
  Additionally, PHP must be running as an Apache module, not
  a CGI.)</p>
  <br />
  <span class="note">Note for Oracle and PostgreSQL:</span> You must also change the value of
  <tt>magic_quotes_sybase</tt> to <tt>On</tt> within the <tt>php.ini</tt>
  settings.</dd>
 <dt>I get an error message from PHP saying "Call to undefined function: ..."</dt>
  <dd>This tells you that your version of PHP is missing something that
    WebCalendar needs.  If the function mentioned is a database login
  function (<em>ociplogin</em>, <em>mysql_pconnect</em>, <em>ibase_connect</em>, <em>pg_pconnect</em>), 
  then you probably do not have the needed database support for your database 
  compiled into PHP.
    If the function is not a database connect call, then check the
    <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP manual</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> 
    to see if the function requires a specific version of PHP.  You
    may have an out-dated version of PHP that requires upgrading.</dd>
 <dt>When I try and view certain pages, nothing happens for 30 seconds, then I get a time-out error.</dt>
  <dd>On slower or very busy servers, it can take some time for the server
    to get all the events.  Most PHP installations have a built-in timeout
    out of 30 seconds and will interrupt any request that takes longer than
    that.  This is most likely to happen on the year-long custom report or
    on the month view when layers are being used.  If you have access,
    you can increase the time-out value for PHP in the <tt>php.ini</tt>
    file by changing the setting of the <tt>max_execution_time</tt> setting.</dd>
 <dt>I get an error message that says "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'."</dt>
  <dd>This is a PHP/MySQL configuration issue. The value of <tt>mysql.default_socket</tt>
  in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file must match the value of <tt>socket</tt> in your 
  <tt>my.cnf</tt> file. Edit the <tt>php.ini</tt> file to fix this problem.</dd>
 <dt>I am not receiving any email messages from WebCalendar.</dt>
  <dd>WebCalendar sends two types of email messages:
    Notifications<a href="#g_notification">*</a> and Reminders<a href="#g_reminder">*</a>. 
  Check the following if you are not receiving any email:
    <ol>
   <li>You have defined a valid SMTP server in your PHP configuration file 
    <tt>php.ini</tt>.  (The setting is "SMTP" in the "mail_function" section.)</li>
   <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, you have set the "Email Enabled" setting to "Yes".</li>
   <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, make sure you have the "Default sender address" 
   to something.
   <br /><span class="note">Note:</span>
          Some mail system will reject mail that has a "From" address
          that is a different domain from the originating SMTP server.
          So, if your SMTP server is smtp.mydomain.com and your "Default sender address" 
   is calendar@someotherdomain.com, some mail systems may bounce the mail back.</li>
       <li>For a Notification, make sure you have the type of Notification
           set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
       <li>For a Reminder:
    <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have "Event reminders" set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
     <li>Make sure you have <a href="#reminders">setup a cron job</a> to periodically 
      run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
    </ol>

 <dt>I forgot/lost my admin password.  How can I reset it?</dt>
  <dd>The easiest way is to admin a new admin user and then use that
    new user to reset the password for your old admin account.
    Assuming you have deleted the original 'admin' login, you can use
    the following SQL to insert a new admin user into the database:
    <pre>INSERT INTO webcal_user ( cal_login, cal_passwd, cal_lastname,
cal_firstname, cal_is_admin ) VALUES
( 'admin', '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3', 'Administrator',
'Default', 'Y' );</pre>
    This will add a user with login 'admin' and password 'admin' to the database.
    If you still have a user named 'admin', then replace 'admin' in the above
    SQL with a different username.
  </dd>
 <dt>I get a database error indicating table <tt>webcal_config</tt> does not exist.</dt>
  <dd>This is the first table that WebCalendar tries to access, so it 
   typically means one of the following:
   <ul>
    <li>You have not created the database tables as described in the instructions</li>
    <li>You have the wrong database name specified in your 
    <tt>includes/settings.php</tt> file</li>
   </ul>

 <h2>Appendix A: Using phpMyAdmin</h2>
<p>
If you have <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a>
installed and configured to manage your MySQL database, use the
following steps to setup WebCalendar.
(The following information is based on phpMyAdmin version 2.6.1.)
</p>
<ol>
<li>On the initial phpMyAdmin page, under the "MySQL" heading, the first
  option should be "Create new database."  Enter the name you have
  chosen for the database and press the "Create" button.
  (The default database name used by WebCalendar is "intranet".)
  After pressing the "Create" button, it should say:
  "Database &lt;your database name here&gt; has been created." </li>
<li>Click on the home icon (the small house) in the left-side
   navigation.  This will bring you back to your phpMyAdmin home page.</li>
<li>(Optional) Create new MySQL user.  If you already have
    a MySQL login that you would like to use, you can skip this step.</li>
<li><ul>
  <li>Click on the "Privileges" link under the "MySQL" heading.</li>
  <li>Below any existing users listed, click on the link "Add a new User."</li>
  <li>Fill in the details of your new database user.
      The default username for WebCalendar is "webcalendar"
      with a password of "webcal01".
      Leave the "Host" field set to "Any host".</li>
  <li>From the list of "Global privileges", be sure to select:
      SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FILE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX, DROP </li>
  <li>Click on the "Go" button.</li>
  <li>You should see a page that says "You have added a new user."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the "Databases" tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li>From the list of databases on the page, click on the name
    of the database that you created.</li>
<li>Click on the "SQL" tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, there is an area to upload a SQL file.
    Click on the "Browse" button and select the <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt>
    file in the WebCalendar toplevel directory.
    Then, press the "Go" button.</li>
<li>The top of the page should say "Your SQL-query has been executed

<h2>Appendix B: Setting Up Reminders on Windows</h2>

<p>You have two options to choose from when setting up email
   reminders on a Windows platform.
   You can either install a cron package for Windows,
   or you can use the Windows Task Scheduler.
</p>

<h3>Installing a Cron Package</h3>
<p>
If you install a cron package for Windows, you will need to setup
to setup a cron job.
(UNIX cron is a tool for used to run tasks as specified times anywhere
from every minute to once a year.)
</p>
<p>
First, you should create a <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file
that contains a single line:
</p>
<pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre>
<p>You can place this <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file anywhere on your
file system.
</p>
<p>Next, you need to setup the cron job.
The crontab entry should look like
the following (replace with the correct path to your
newly created <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file):
</p>

<pre>1 * * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre>

<p>The "1 * * * *" will tell the cron schedule to run this task
at 1 after the hour all day long (12:01am, 1:01am, 2:01am, etc.)
If you only want to run it once per day, you could use:
</p>
<pre>1 4 * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre>
<p>This would tell the cron scheduler to run the task at 4:01am
every day.
For more information about the syntax of cron, check the documentation
for the package you have installed or
view the UNIX man page for crontab
(like <a href="http://www.rt.com/man/crontab.5.html"
  target="_blank">this one</a>).
</p>


<p>There are many cron packages for Windows available.
   Below is a list of packages to choose from.
   (Note: use at your own risk.  These links are provided
   for information only.)

</ul>

<h3>Using the Windows Task Schedule</h3>

<p>Follow the steps listed below to setup a new task
   in the Windows Task Scheduler.
   (These instructions were created with Windows XP Professional.
   Other versions of Windows might be different.)
</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a new batch file called <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt>.
    The contents of this file should be a single line:
    <pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre>
  </li>

<li>On Windows XP, go to Control Panel</li>
<li>Double-click on "Scheduled Tasks."
  This brings up a window that says "Scheduled Task Wizard" </li>
 
<li>Click on "Browse..." </li>
 
<li>Select the location of your newly created
    <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file.</li>
<li>Click on "Open" </li>
 
<li>Change the name of the task. "WebCalendar Reminders" is a good name.
  </li>
 
<li>Select how often to perform this task.  Select "Daily." </li>
<li>Click on "Next" </li>
 
<li>Select the start time, then click "Next".
    If you are planning on sending out reminders throughout the
    day, pick a time shortly after midnight. </li>
 
<li> Enter your user password as required. Click on "Next." </li>
 
<li> Select the checkbox "Open advanced properites". </li>
<li> Click on "Finish." </li>
 
<li> Under the "Schedule" tab, click on "Advanced." </li>

<li> Click on "Repeat Task" and fill in the details of how often
     the job should run.
     For example, you can set it to run "every 15 minutes", then
     click on "until" and set that time to 11:30pm.
  </li>

<h2>Appendix C: Displaying Upcoming Events on Your Site</h2>

<p>
If you would like to list upcoming events somewhere on a page on your site

you can use the <tt>upcoming.php</tt> page to do this.
This page is intended to be included in other pages using the
<tt>iframe</tt> tag.
</p>
<p>You may need to modify some of the variables near the top of
<tt>upcoming.php</tt> with a text editor:
</p>
<table border="0" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">

<tr><td valign="top">$public_must_be_enabled</td>
  <td>
      Specifies if Public Access must be enabled in System Settings
      for this page to be viewed.
      <br/>Default setting: false
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$display_link</td>
  <td>
      Specifies if events should have a link to the URL
      within WebCalendar to view the event.
      <br/>Default setting: true
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$link_target</td>
  <td>
      Specifies the name of the window that be used for
      the link target.
      <br/>Default setting: _top
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$numDays</td>
  <td>
      Specifies how many days of events should be listed.
      <br/>Can override this by passing "num" in within the URL

      <br/>Default setting: 30
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$maxEvents</td>
  <td>
      Specifies the maximum number of events to list.
      <br/>Default setting: 10
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$username</td>
  <td>
      The login of the calendar to display upcoming events for.
      If you want to see upcoming events for user login "joe",
      then you would change this to "joe".
      <br/>Default setting: __public__ (The public calendar)
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$allow_user_override</td>
  <td>
      Specifies whether the calendar user can be specified in the URL
      (in which case the $username setting will be ignored) using
      a URL like "upcoming.php?user=joe".
      <br/>Default setting: true
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$load_layers</td>
  <td>
      Specifies if the calendar user's layers should also be
      included in the upcoming events.
      <br/>Note: Layers must be enabled in the user's preferences.
      <br/>Default setting: true
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$cat_id</td>

<h2>Appendix D: How To Configure For LDAP</h2>

<p>Configuring WebCalendar to use an existing LDAP directory is fairly 
simple.  It is know to work with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory and 
should work with other systems as well. <span class="note">Note:</span> 
If you use LDAP, the group functionailty of WebCalendar does not yet work.   
</p>

<p>To configure WebCalendar to use LDAP, do the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Configure <tt>settings.php</tt></li>
 <li>Configure <tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The first step is to set WebCalendar to use LDAP authentication in 
<tt>settings.php</tt>.  Instructions on to do this can be found in the

In summary, the following should be set:<br />
<tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
<tt>user_inc = user-ldap.php</tt><br />
</p>

<p>The next step is a little more work and involves editing the 
<tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt> file with a text editor.  You will have
to set several configuration variables.  If you don't know what to set 
the variables to, consult your LDAP system administrator.  Documentation 
exists for all variables in the file.  Finally, users have gotten LDAP 
working with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory by just changing the 
following:</p>

<table border="0" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_server</td>
  <td>
      FQDN or IP address of the LDAP server (or localhost).
      <br />ex. 'ldapserver.company.com'
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_base_dn</td>
  <td>
      Specifies the base DN used to search for users
      <br />ex. 'ou=people,dc=company,dc=com' or 'o=context,ou=subcontext'
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_admin_group_name</td>
  <td>
      Specifies a group (complete DN) with admin rights for WebCalendar
      <br />You might have to create one in LDAP 
      <br />ex. 'cn=it,ou=group,dc=company,dc=com'
  </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Using SSL with LDAP</h3>
<p>If the LDAP server will accept connections over SSL, simply add 'ldaps://'
to the beginning of <tt>$ldap_server</tt>.  <br />Example: ldaps://ldapserver.company.com
</p>

<h3>Using TLS with LDAP</h3>
<p>If the LDAP server is set up to use TLS, just set <tt>$ldap_start_tls = true</tt>.
