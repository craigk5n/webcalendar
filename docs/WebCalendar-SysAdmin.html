 <ul>
  <li>pilot-link (if exporting to Palm):
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158">http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>
 </ul>
 <p><a name="database">You must have one of the following databases installed</a>:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Oracle 8+</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Interbase</li>
  <li>MS SQL Server</li>
  <li>SQLLite (PHP5)</li>
  <li>IBM DB2 </li>
  <li>ODBC</li>
 </ul>

 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span>PHP ODBC includes support for Adabas D, Solid
   and Sybase SQL Anywhere as well as ODBC. PHP5 comes bundled with
   SQLite support. SQLite is an embedded file-based database. If your
   hosting service supports PHP5, you should be able to create as
   many SQLite databases as you like (since each database is just
   a file).</p>
 <p>For the database you choose, you must have its drivers built into
  PHP. For example, to use MySQL, PHP must be compiled with MySQL
  support (which is the default setting when installing PHP).
  See the PHP pages (<a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.php.net" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>)
  for more information on setting up PHP.</p>
 <p>No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
  application. However, PHP should be compiled with <tt>--enable-track-vars</tt>
  on some systems.</p>
 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span>If you want to use gradient background
   images, PHP must be compiled with the GD library. </p>

  <p>You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module. You'll get better
  performance with PHP setup as a module. Not only will you not have to
  deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
  database connection pooling. Additionally, this application can use
  a form/cookie-based authentication or traditional HTTP authentication.
  For traditional HTTP authentication, PHP must be built as an Apache
  module.</p>
 <p>If you are planning on using email reminders, you will need to build
  PHP as a CGI in order to run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script. I would
  strongly recommend building a module-based PHP for your web server
  and then a second PHP build to create the CGI version.</p>
 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> Some Linux distributions come with both a module-based PHP
  with Apache and a standalone PHP binary.
  Check for <tt>/usr/bin/php</tt> to see if you already have the
  PHP standalone executable. If it's there, you can use
  the following command to see what version of PHP you have:
  <br /><br />
  <tt style="margin-left: 50px;">/usr/bin/php -v</tt>
 </p>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="fileunpacking"></a>
<h2>File Unpacking</h2>
 <p>Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
  your web server will find it. (See your web server documentation for information.)</p>
 <p>By default, unpacking WebCalendar will create its own directory
  when you unpack it. The new directory name will typically
  contain the version name (such as <tt>WebCalendar-1.2.7</tt>).
  You can rename this directory after unpacking the files if you
  prefer a directory name like <tt>calendar</tt> or <tt>webcalendar</tt>.
  Keep in mind that unless you remap the directory (via your web server's
  configuration settings), it will be part of the URL for the calendar.</p>
 <div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="appsetup"></a>
 <h2>Application Installation</h2>

 <p>WebCalendar now includes an installation script that will guide you through
 the entire installation process.
 It should run automatically when first accessing
 a new installation or when a major version upgrade has been performed.
 The installation
 script can always be rerun if needed by adding <tt>install/index.php</tt>
 to your base WebCalendar URL. </p>

 <h3>WebCalendar Installation Wizard: Step 1</h3>
 <p>When first run, the installation script will prompt you for a
 <em>Configuration Wizard Password</em> that will protect against unauthorized
 tampering. Until this password is set, your WebCalendar installation and possibly your database are vulnerable to attack. Once, you've set your password, be sure
 to write it down. If forgotten, the only way to recover is to manually edit the
 <tt>install/settings.php</tt> file.</p>

 <p>The installation script will now check several prerequisites and report the
 results. Any item that appears in <font color="#FF0000">RED</font> should be
  corrected before continuing.</p>

 <table cellpadding="2">
 <tr><th>Prerequisite Failed</th><th>Recommended Solution</th></tr>
 <tr>
   <td>PHP 4.1.0 or greater</td>
   <td>Upgrade your PHP installation</td>

   <td>If unable to to set Safe Mode Off, then set safe_mode_allowed_vars to contain
   <tt>TZ</tt> in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2">* NOTE: If neither of the these settings pass testing, then
   your WebCalendar installation will be restricted to using the server's timezone
   setting only.</td>

     for all users (<tt>chmod 777 includes</tt>). On Windows, change this directory
      to have full access for all users using Windows Explorer.</td>
 </tr>

 <h3>WebCalendar Installation Wizard: STEP 2</h3>

 <p>The installation script can create your WebCalendar database as well as create all the required tables and pre-populate them with the basic configuration data. These features are only available when using fully supported database types. See
 <a href="#appendixB">Appendix B</a> to manually create your database if needed.</p>

 <p><strong>Database Status</strong></p>
 <p>Displays the current status of your database settings as well the supported
 databases for your PHP installation.</p>

 <p><strong>Database Settings</strong></p>
<p>To configure your database access. Set the values for:</p>
 <table class="distinguish">
  <tr><th>Displayed Value</th><th>settings.php value</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Database Type</td><td>db_type</td>
  <td>
   One of "mysql", "oracle", "postgresql", "odbc",
   &quot;mssql&quot;, sqllite, db2,
   or "ibase"
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>
   Server</td><td>db_host</td><td>
   The hostname that database is running on.
   (Use localhost if it's the same machine as
   the web server.) (This variable is not used with ODBC, enter 'none')
   (Use 'none' if your db server does not use a TCP socket to connect)
   (If using a special PORT, you can specify it as HOST:PORT)
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Login</td><td>db_login</td><td>
   The database login
   (Not used for SQLite.)
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Database Name</td><td>db_password</td><td>
   The database password for the above login<br />
   (Use 'none' if your db server does not use a TCP socket to connect.)
   (Not used for SQLite.)
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Database Name</td><td>db_database</td><td>
   The name of the database that the calendar
   tables reside in. ("intranet" in the <a href="#dbsetup">examples above</a>.)
   For ODBC, this should be the DSN.
   For SQLite, this is the filename that will be used.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Connection Persistence</td><td>db_persistent</td><td>
   Enable use of persistent (pooled) database connections.
   This should typically be enabled. This setting may be disabled for CGI installations.
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>
   Database Cache Directory</td><td>db_cachedir</td>
   <td>
   To enable caching of database query results, enter a writable directory. This
     directory should NOT be in the webserver document path to prevent unauthorized
     access to cached  sensitive data such as passwords hashes and private event
     details.
    To disable this feature, leave this field blank.
    However, this feature is recommended to enhance your system's performance.
  </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>Click the <font color="#FF0000">Test Settings</font> button to perform the test your settings.</p>

 <p>Click the <font color="#FF0000">Create</font> button to have the installation
   script create your database. This option will only be available for fully
   supported database types. Retest your database settings if prompted to do
   so.</p>

 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span>If this step does not complete
   properly, then you will have to manually create your database. Detailed instructions
   can be found in <a href="#appendixB">Appendix B</a>. Then rerun the installation
   script to continue the installation.</p>

 <h3>WebCalendar Installation Wizard: STEP 3</h3>
 <p>In this section we will perform the required database changes to bring your database up to the required level If you are using a fully supported database, this step will be performed automatically for you If not, the required SQL can be displayed and you should be able to cut &amp; paste it into your database server query window.</p>

 <p><strong>Database Status</strong></p>
 <p>This should display the current installed version of WebCalendar as well as the version being installed.</p>

 <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The following database actions are required</strong>
 </font></p>

 <p>If using a fully supported database type, clicking the <strong>Update Database</strong> button  will create any tables required for this installation or upgrade. If this feature is
 not supported, then this button will not be available.</p>

<p>The <strong>Display Required SQL</strong> button will always be available
  and if clicked will display the required SQL text that can then be cut &amp; pasted
  into the SQL query window of your database program. If using the approach,
  please rerun the installation script after completing your required database
  updates.</p>

 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span>If this step does not complete properly,
   then you will have to manually create your database tables. Detailed instructions
   can be found in <a href="#appendixF">Appendix F</a>. Then rerun the installation
   script to continue the  installation.</p>

 <h3>WebCalendar Installation Wizard: STEP 4</h3>

<p><strong>Timezone Conversion</strong></p>
<p>If upgrading WebCalendar from a previous version, you may be prompted to perform a Timezone Conversion. WebCalendar version 1.0.4 and earlier stored event date and time in the server's
timezone. As of v1.1.0, all event date and time information is stored as UTC time. So, a one-time conversion of existing events will required to prevent event displayed times from
appearing incorrectly.</p>

<p><strong>Application Settings</strong></p>

<p>Create Default Admin Account: If checked, a DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR account will be created with username:admin password:admin</p>

<p>Application Name: The default value <strong>Title</strong> will be translated into
 <strong>WebCalendar</strong> into the user's language. Any other entry will not be
translated unless entries are made into the appropriate language.txt files.</p>

<p>Server URL: This should be the full URL to access your WebCalendar installation.The trailing "/" is required for proper operation. If this field is left blank, WebCalendar will
calculate the proper value and store it in the database.</p>

<p>User Authentication: You can configure the calendar to run in single-user<a href="#g_singleuser">*</a> mode or
 multi-user<a href="#g_multiuser">*</a> mode. If this is your first time using the
 calendar, it's easier to try single-user. You can always switch to multi-user
 later. Leave <tt>single_user</tt> set to "false" (the default) for multi-user or set
 it to "true" and set the value of <tt>single_user_login</tt> to a login name of your liking
 to set the system to single-user mode. (And be sure to set the value of
 <tt>single_user_login</tt> to the login that you would choose if you decide to switch
 to multi-user mode some day.)</p>
 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode, make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the
  <tt>single_user_login</tt> variable to. You will need to do this via the
  database (mysql, sqlplus, etc.)  Look in the <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt>
  (or <tt>tables-oracle.sql</tt>, etc.) to see the example of adding in the "admin" user.</p>
 <p>If you are setting up a multi-user calendar, you will need to choose
  how your users are authenticated. You must change the settings of
  <tt>use_http_auth</tt> and <tt>user_inc</tt>
  to setup which authentication method to use.</p>
 <p>You currently have five choices:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Web-based authentication (login/passwords verified in the WebCalendar database):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user.php</tt>
  </li>
  <li>HTTP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by the web server):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = true</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user.php</tt><br />
   ... and don't forget to setup your web server to handle user
   authentication.<br />
          <span class="note">Note:</span> In order to use HTTP-based authentication,
    PHP must be setup as a module for your server rather than a CGI.
  </li>
  <li>NIS-based authentication (login/passwords verified by NIS):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user-nis.php</tt><br />
   Additional configuration settings will need to be set
   in <tt>includes/user-nis.php</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>LDAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by LDAP server):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user-ldap.php</tt><br />
   Additional configuration settings will need to be set
   in <tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>IMAP-based authentication (login/passwords verified by IMAP server):<br />
   <tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
   <tt>user_inc = user-imap.php</tt><br />
   Additional configuration settings will need to be set
   in <tt>includes/user-imap.php</tt>.
  </li>
 </ol>

<p>Read-Only: Determines whether events can be added to your WebCalendar.</p>

<p>Environment: Normally set this <strong>Production</strong>. Development will allow
more verbose sql logging and should not be used unless needed.</p>

<p>After saving your settings, you should be provided with a
<strong>Launch WebCalendar</strong>  button that will open WebCalendar in a separate
browser window.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You have successfully installed WebCalendar on
your system.</strong></p>

    <p>Keep in mind that if you want to use reminders, you will need to
  setup the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script (see below) and keep your admin
  setting for "Email enabled" set to "Yes" on the admin settings page.</p>
    <p>At this point, your WebCalendar installation should be up and running.
  To access WebCalendar open up your favorite web browser and
  type in the URL. The URL will depend on where you installed WebCalendar.</p>

 <p class="ptip"><span class="tip">TIP</span> On a multi-user system, the only user account created
 during installation has the username of "admin" and a password of "admin". You should create
 a new admin account and delete this one for security reasons.</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>

<hr />

<a name="eventcal"></a>
<h2>Configuring as Event Calendar</h2>

<p>
  If you intend to use WebCalendar as an event calendar, you will
  need to enable "Public Access" in the System Settings with the following
  steps:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Login to WebCalendar as an administrator (the default username is
        'admin' and password 'admin'). </li>
   <li>Click on the "Admin" link at the bottom of any page.</li>
   <li>Click on the "System Settings" button.</li>
   <li>Click on the "Public Access" tab.</li>
   <li>Select "Yes" for "Allow public access".</li>
  </ul>
<p>This will allow users to access WebCalendar without a username and
password. Only events that are created with the "Public User" as
an event participant will show up in your event calendar for users
who have not logged in. If events are not showing up on your public
calendar, make sure the events have the "Public User" as a participant
and the event has been approved.
</p>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>

<hr />

<a name="users"></a>
 <h2>Creating Users</h2>
 <p>After logging in as an admin user (the initial username is "admin" with
  password "admin"), you will see a common set of links at the bottom

 <h2>Setting Up Email Reminders</h2>
 <p>PHP does not come with a utility for executing time-based jobs.
  So, in order to check periodically for email reminders, a shell
  script was written in PHP. You will need two things to get this working:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>You should have a version of PHP built as a CGI (so that you can run
    php from the command line). This does not mean you must build all
    of PHP as a CGI. You can still build PHP as a module for your web
  server and then build the CGI-based PHP later.<br />
    <span class="note">Note:</span> Many Linux distributions and some Windows LAMP packages
    come with the PHP built for CGI.</li>
  <li>You must setup cron (on Linux/UNIX) or something like cron for Windows
  to run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script periodically.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Building PHP as a CGI is outside the scope of these instructions. But,
  if you read the PHP instructions, you'll see that the default build
  settings will build the CGI-based PHP. If you really can't do this
  (perhaps you don't have permission to install anything new on the
  system), skip down a couple of paragraphs to an alternate solution
  that does not require PHP CGI.</p>
 <p>For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of
  a user. (This would be the same user that the web server
  process runs as.)</p>
 <pre><tt>1 * * * * cd /some/directory/webcalendar/tools; ./send_reminders.php</tt></pre>
    <p>Of course, replace the directory location to wherever the
  <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> file can be found. If you moved this out of the
  tools directory (which is recommended for security reasons),
  be sure to update <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> since it needs
  to know where to find other WebCalendar files.</p>
    <p>If you cannot setup PHP as a CGI or have no idea how, you can leave
  <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> in its current location and access it via a URL.
  IMHO, this is not the best choice, but it still works. Setup a cron
  job to access the URL. For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to
  the crontab entry of a user.</p>
 <pre><tt>1 * * * * wget http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php &gt; /dev/null</tt></pre>
<p>Some users have reported the following works better for their configuration.</p>
<pre><tt>1 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php</tt>
</pre>
  <p>You should test this from the command line first to make sure your setup is
  correct. If you do not have <tt>wget</tt> installed on your system, you can use
  any tool (lynx, perl script, etc.) that is capable of making an HTTP request for this.</p>

  <h3>User Access Control</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt> User Access Control enabled</dt>
   <dd>User Access Control provides more advanced control of
       user access permissions.
       If enabled, a "User Access Control" button will appear on the
   main Admin page and/or on the Settings menu of the NEW top menu. This page
   will allow you to configure: </dd>
   <dd>
     <ul>
       <li>which functions in the system each user can access </li>
       <li>which user calendars each user can access
           (user A can edit events on user B's calendar, etc.)</li>
       </ul>
   </dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>Groups</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>Groups enabled</dt>
   <dd>Specifies if group features should be enabled</dd>
  <dt>User sees only his group</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, users will be unaware of any users that are not in the same group as the user.</dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>NonUser Calendars</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>Nonuser Calendars Enabled</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, you may create "nonuser calendars" in WebCalendar.
     A nonuser calendar is a calendar without a user login. It can
     be used to manage a resource like a conference room's availability.
     Or it can be used to place common events (like holidays) that multiple
     users may want to access as a layer.
     You will need to enable nonuser calendars in order to subscribe
     to remote iCalendar URLs from within WebCalendar (allowing the events
     from an iCalendar or hCalendar file elsewhere on the net to appear in your
     WebCalendar calendar.)
   </dd>
   <dt>Display in participants list at</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, then nonuser calendars can be selected as
       participants to events.</dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>Other</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>Reports enabled</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, user's will be able to create and generate reports.</dd>
  <dt><em>Allow remote subscriptions</em></dt>

   <dd>
      <ul style="margin-left:70px;"><li ><strong>publish.php</strong> will provide outbound publishing to a calendar client</li>
   <li><strong>icalclient.php</strong> will provide two-way full synchronization between WebCalendar and another calendar client such as Sunbird, Apple iCal.
      (PHP 4.3+ required)</li>
      </ul></dd>

 <dt>Allow remote calendars</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, user's will be able to add a special type Non-User Calendar
     that includes a URL that point to the remote location. The user can manually
     synchronize the remote calendars if desired. In addition, <tt>tool/reload_remotes.php</tt>
     can be set up as a cron job to automatically reload all remote calendars
     as desired. Currently both iCalendar and hCalendar calendars can be consumed
     by WebCalendar. The  calendar type should be automatically detected based
     on the URL and calendar content. Users will need to create a layer to make
     a remote calendar visible on their calendars, just like regular Non-User
     Calendars.</dd>
   <dt>Enable RSS feed</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, a link is added to all pages that permits some browsers to
     create a persistent RSS feed to that page. Currently, only Firefox and IE
     7.0 supports this functionality. Also, the setting will enable the use of
     the rss.php script generate RSS feeds to RSS clients. User's will also be
     required to enable this feature in their respective preference settings.</dd>
   <dt>Categories enabled</dt>
   <dd>Specifies if category features should be enabled</dd>
   <dt>Category Icon Upload enabled</dt>
   <dd>Specifies if category icons can be uploaded by users. This requires that
     a folder named <tt>icons</tt> exist in the WebCalendar directory.</dd>
  <dt><em>Display small task list</em></dt>
   <dd>If enabled, a small task window will be displayed in the month and day calendars. These tasks are compatible with the VTODO component of RFC2445 (iCalendar)</dd>
  <dt><em>Display tasks in Calendars</em></dt>
   <dd>If enabled, tasks are displayed along with events in calendars. The date they appear is the due date but if the due date has passed without the task being completed, the task will shift to the current day.</dd>
<!--  <dt>Export VTIMEZONE in iCalendar (ics) files</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, a complete VTIMEZONE component will be exported with iCalendar (ics) files as necessary. This function requires considerable processing time, so it should not be enabled unless needed.</dd>
-->
  <dt>Allow external users</dt>
  <dd>If enabled, the create/edit event page will contain a text area to include
  the names (and optional email address) of event participants that are not calendar users.</dd>
  <dt>External users can receive email notifications</dt>
  <dd>If enabled, event participants entered into the External Participants area will receive email notifications at the same time as calendar users (if an email address was specified for the External Participant).</dd>
  <dt>External users can receive email reminders</dt>
  <dd>If enabled, event participants entered into the External Participants area will receive email reminders at the same time as calendar users (if an email address was specified for the External Participant).</dd>
  <dt>Allow self-registration</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, new users are permitted to setup their own accounts and log into WebCalendar without admin intervention. <font color="#FF0000">Use with caution!</font></dd>
  <dt>Restrict self-registration to blacklist</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, admin can configure the includes/blacklist.php to restrict or permit self-registration based on the user's IP. This will restrict access to existing users or new user's set up by admin. Details and examples are available in the top of the file.</dd>
   <dt>Generate passwords and send to new users</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, self-registration user's will be emailed a randomly generated password that they can then use to access WebCalendar normally. Hopefully, this will prevent some spammers and hackers from misusing the self-registration process.</dd>
   <dt>Allow file attachments to events</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, attachments can be uploaded and associated with events. The
     attachments are stored in the database, so care should be taken if performance
     is an issue. Additionally, permission may extended to participants and/or
     anyone.</dd>
   <dt>Allow comments to events</dt>
   <dd>If enabled, comments can be associated with events. Additionally,
   permission may extended to participants and/or anyone. </dd>
 </dl>
 <h3>Email</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>Email enabled</dt>
   <dd>Specifies if email functionality should be enabled. If set to "No," then no email messages will be sent at any time.</dd>

 <h2>Custom Event Fields</h2>
 <p>You may want to customize the event-specific fields found in
  the <tt>includes/site_extras.php</tt> field.
  If this is your first time using the calendar, you can skip
  this step and come back later since this step
  is <em>optional</em>.</p>
 <p>You can use this feature to add extra
  fields to your calendar events. For example, you can add a URL,
  a contact email address, or a pulldown containing predefined attributes.</p>
 <p>When defining a new custom field, the following types listed below
  are available. "Arg 1" and "Arg 2" have different meaning depending on the type
  of field. In some cases, "Arg 1" and "Arg 2" are not used.</p>

 <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
 <dl>
<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Installation/Setup -->
  <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on Windows?</dt>
   <dd>The easiest way to do this is to try one of the prepackaged bundles that will install all of these for you:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www.foxserv.net/">FoxServ</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxserv.net" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>

    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on Mac OS X?</dt>
   <dd>You can use the built-in Apache/PHP installed on Mac OS X.
       However, this does not inlude MySQL.  An easier way to
       setup WebCalendar would be to use one of the following
       packages:
    <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a></li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I setup PHP, MySQL and Apache on UNIX/Linux?</dt>
  <dd>There are many online instructions on how to do this. Here are a few:

    </ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>I've finished the install. What is the login to WebCalendar?</dt>
  <dd>After the initial creation of the database tables, there will
    be a single user account created with the username "admin" and
    the password set to "admin" as well.
    <br /><span class="note">Note:</span> This account is intended to get your started.
    You should create a new admin account and delete this one.</dd>
 <dt><a name="samplepublic">I want to use WebCalendar as an events calendar for
    my organization. How do I set it up to do this?</a></dt>
  <dd>You will want to setup WebCalendar to use public access.
    <ol>
    <li>Setup your <tt>settings.php</tt> file as a multi-user
      system (see <a href="#appsetup">instructions</a>).</li>
    <li>In System Settings, set "Allow public access" to "Yes."</li>
    <li>If you want people to be able to submit new events
      through public access, set "Public access can add events"
      to "Yes."</li>
    <li>If you set "Public access can add events" to "Yes",
      set the setting for "Public access new events
      require approval" to your liking. If you set this to "Yes,"
      an admin user will need to approve any new events before
      they will appear on the public access calendar.</li>
    <li>Login using one of the accounts you have setup.
       Add a new event, and select "Public User" as one of the
       participants.</li>
    <li>If you have enabled "Require event approvals" in your
       System Settings, then you will need to approve the new
       event. Choose the "Unapproved Events" at the bottom
       of any page (you must be an admin user to access this).
       You will be presented with a list of unapproved events
       (for both the current user and for the Public User account).
       Approve the new event for the Public User.</li>
    <li>Go to the Login page. You will see a "Access public calendar"
       link that will bring you to the calendar for public access.</li>
    <li>By default, the index.php page should send users to
       the public calendar.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>

 <dt>How can I add holidays to the calendar?</dt>
 <dd>There is no built-in support for holidays because it is
 not necessary. You can add holidays into WebCalendar by importing
 one of the many iCalendar holiday files that are freely available.
 A good resource for free iCalendar files is
 <a href="http://www.icalshare.com">iCalShare
        <img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>.
 For example, the U.S. holiday iCalendar file can be downloaded from:
 <blockquote>
 <a href="http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521">http://icalshare.com/article.php?story=20020912105939521
        <img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> </blockquote>
 If you don't want each individual user to have to import
 the holiday calendar, you can use nonuser calendars.
 First, make sure nonuser calendars are enabled in your
 system settings. Then, from Admin-&gt;Users, you can
 access nonuser calendars. Create a new nonuser calendar
 (such as "usholidays"). Then, notify your users that they
 can add this nonuser calendar as a layer to their own
 calendar in order to see the holidays. </dd>

 <dt>Why are deleted events still present in the database?</dt>
  <dd>When you delete an event from your calendar, it is not
    deleted from the database. Instead, it is marked as deleted.
    This allows the system administrator access to information
    even after it is deleted.</dd>
 <dt>Can I setup more than one public calendar?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot directly setup two public calendars. However,
    there are two options for emulating this type of functionality:
    <ul>
    <li>You can <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#categories">create global categories</a> and point users to the calendar with only a certain category displayed.</li>
    <li>You can setup multiple NonUser calendars and enable
        public access viewing of other users' calendars.
        You can then link directly to the calendar of one of
        the NonUser calendars, or you can
        <a href="WebCalendar-UserManual.html#views">setup a view</a>
        that contains the calendar of one or more of the NonUser calendars.</li>
    </ul>
   </dd>
 <dt>How do I change the title "Public Access" at the top of
 the calendar?</dt>
  <dd>In the file <tt>translations/English-US.txt</tt>,
  change the line that says "Public Access" to what you want
  it to say on the right side.<br /><br />Example:
  <pre>Public Access: Foobar Event Calendar</pre>
  </dd>
 <dt>Can I embed WebCalendar as a component on another web page?</dt>
  <dd>WebCalendar is meant to be run as a standalone web application.
    You can customize the appearance of WebCalendar to match your existing
    site.
    To do this, In System Settings, set both "Custom header" and
  "Custom trailer" to "Yes" and press the "Edit" button to enter the
    header and trailer content.
    <br />
    If you are looking to just include a list of upcoming events in one
    of your web pages, you can use the <tt>upcoming.php</tt> page in
    WebCalendar to do this. Edit the top of this file to configure options.
    (These settings will likely move into System Settings in subsequent release.)
    You can then use an <tt>iframe</tt> elsewhere on your web site as
    in the example below:
    <pre>&lt;iframe height="250" width="300" scrolling="yes" src="upcoming.php"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>
    Include this HTML anywhere on any of your pages.
    By default, the events from the public calendar will be loaded (so
    you must have "Public Access" enabled in System Settings).
    You can override this with another user's calendar.
    (See <tt>upcoming.php</tt> for instructions on this.)
    <br /><br />
    If you would like to display a small calendar (like the ones on the month view), you can add the
    following example. There are some configuration options available in the top of this file as well.
    You can then use an <tt>iframe</tt> elsewhere on your web site as
    in the example below:
    <pre>&lt;iframe height="200" width="180" scrolling="yes" src="minical.php"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I customize the appearance of WebCalendar so that it matches
     the rest of my site?</dt>
  <dd>You can customize the appearance of WebCalendar to match your existing
    site.
    To do this, In System Settings, set both "Custom header" and
    "Custom trailer" to "Yes", and press the "Save" button.
    Then click on the "Edit" button to enter your site content.
    The custom header will be included after the document's HTML
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag but before any WebCalendar content.
    The custom trailer will be included after the WebCalendar content
    and before the document's HTML <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.
    If you want to add JavaScript or Stylesheet data, you can use
    the "Custom script/stylesheet" option on the same System Settings page.
    Any content entered will be included within the document's HTML
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. </dd>
 <dt>How do I add a new translation?</dt>
  <dd>
  It's a fairly simple process. If you've ever translated a C-based app
     that used GNU's gettext tool, then you'll have no problem. The I18N
     support was based on GNU's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">gettext</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>. Here's what you need to do.
     <ol>
     <li>look in the "translations" directory</li>
     <li>copy the <tt>English-US.txt</tt> file into what you'd like to call your
       language data file. (e.g. <tt>cp English-US.txt French.txt</tt>)</li>
     <li>Now translate all the text to the _right_ of the ": " into the
       new language. Do <em>not</em> alter the text to the left of the ": ".</li>
     <li>When you're done making changes, move into the "tools" directory.
       Run the <tt>check_translation.pl</tt> script on your new data file to make
       sure you have all the needed translations.
       (e.g. <tt>perl check_translation.pl French</tt>)</li>
     <li>Add the new language to both the $languages array and the
       $browser_languages arrays defined in <tt>includes/translate.php</tt>.</li>
     <li>Test it out... </li>
  <li>Post a copy of your translation (along with your changes to <tt>includes/translate.php</tt>) to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870">SourceForge Patches</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> for WebCalendar.</li>
     </ol>
  </dd>
 <dt>How do I update an existing translation?</dt>
  <dd>Just open up the translation file in the <tt>translations</tt> directory
     with your favorite text editor (like vi, vim, emacs, pico, Notepad, etc.).
     In particular look for places where missing translations are indicated.
     All missing translations should be marked with a
  "&lt;&lt;&nbsp;MISSING&nbsp;&gt;&gt;" note.
  and typically the English version of the translation will also be included on the following line (as in the example below):
    <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING &gt;&gt;
# Edit:
#</pre><br />
  For some text, an abbreviation may be used rather than the English text.
  In those cases, the full text will be noted as in the following example:
  <pre># &lt;&lt; MISSING &gt;&gt;
# custom-script-help:
# English text: Allows entry of custom Javascript or stylesheet text that
# will be inserted into the HTML "head" section of every page.
#</pre><br />
     When you're done making changes, move into the <tt>tools</tt> directory.
       Run the <tt>check_translation.pl</tt> script on your new data file to make
       sure you have all the needed translations:
  <pre><tt>perl check_translation.pl French</tt></pre>
     Post a copy of your translation to the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870">SourceForge Patches</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> for WebCalendar.</dd>
<dt>During Import, I receive this error: Unknown Timezone: XXXXX defaulting to GMT.</dt>
<dd>This is a notice that your import file contained unknown timezone information.
  WebCalendar will simply save the event or task as GMT. You are encouraged to
  submit these notices as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/">Bug Reports to SourceForge</a>, so that WebCalendar can improve its TZID support.</dd>

 <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <dl>
<!-- cek: leave these comments here... extractfaqs.pl looks for them -->
<!-- START FAQ: Troubleshooting -->
 <dt>I get error messages about undefined variables when I try to view any page.</dt>
  <dd>On newer versions of PHP, the default setting of PHP is to display
    messages when an undefined variable is referenced. To prevent
    these messages from being displayed, change the setting of <tt>error_reporting</tt>
    in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file to be:
    <pre>error_reporting = E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE</pre>
    Alternately, you can disable any error messages from being displayed
    in the browser and have them logged to a file. (See the comments
    included in the <tt>php.ini</tt> file for instructions on how to do this.)</dd>
 <dt><a name="dbCacheError">I receive an error message saying "Error removing temporary file" or "Cache error".</a></dt>
   <dd>This indicates that a file in your database cache directory could not be
   deleted or created.
   The quickest solution to this problem is to not use the database
   cache.  Simply remote the <tt>db_cachedir</tt> line from
   <tt>includes/settings.php</tt> with a simple text editor.
   This error is most common when the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script
   is run from a cron job under a different system account than the
   PHP application server is running under.  This causes files created by
   the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script to be owned by a different
   user than normal, preventing the PHP application from being able to
   remove the files when needed.
</dd>
 <dt>I receive an error message saying "Failed opening 'includes/...' for inclusion ..."</dt>
   <dd>You may have to modify the <tt>include_path</tt> setting
       in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file. Most users do not need to do this,
       but some PHP installs seem to require it. You will need to
       add the WebCalendar directory to the list of directories
       for <tt>include_path</tt>.</dd>
 <dt>I get an error message from PHP saying "Call to undefined function: ..."</dt>
  <dd>This tells you that your version of PHP is missing something that
    WebCalendar needs. If the function mentioned is a database login
  function (<em>ociplogin</em>, <em>mysql_pconnect</em>, <em>ibase_connect</em>, <em>pg_pconnect</em>),
  then you probably do not have the needed support for your database
  compiled into PHP.
    If the function is not a database connect call, then check the
    <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP manual</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>
    to see if the function requires a specific version of PHP. You
    may have an out-dated version of PHP that requires upgrading.</dd>
 <dt>When I try and view certain pages, nothing happens for 30 seconds, then I get a time-out error.</dt>
  <dd>On slower or very busy servers, it can take some time for the server
    to get all the events. Most PHP installations have a built-in timeout
    out of 30 seconds and will interrupt any request that takes longer than
    that. This is most likely to happen on the year-long custom report or
    on the month view when layers are being used. If you have access,
    you can increase the time-out value for PHP in the <tt>php.ini</tt>
    file by changing the setting of the <tt>max_execution_time</tt> setting.</dd>
 <dt>I get an error message that says "Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'."</dt>
  <dd>This is a PHP/MySQL configuration issue. The value of <tt>mysql.default_socket</tt>
  in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file must match the value of <tt>socket</tt> in your
  <tt>my.cnf</tt> file. Edit the <tt>php.ini</tt> file to fix this problem.</dd>
 <dt>I am not receiving any email messages from WebCalendar.</dt>
  <dd>WebCalendar sends two types of email messages:
    Notifications<a href="#g_notification">*</a> and Reminders<a href="#g_reminder">*</a>.
  Check the following if you are not receiving any email:
    <ol>
   <li>You have defined a valid SMTP server in your PHP configuration file
    <tt>php.ini</tt>. (The setting is "SMTP" in the "mail_function" section.)</li>
   <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, you have set the "Email Enabled" setting to "Yes".</li>
   <li>In WebCalendar's System Settings, make sure you have the "Default sender address"
   to something.
   <br /><span class="note">Note:</span>
          Some mail system will reject mail that has a "From" address
          that is a different domain from the originating SMTP server.
          So, if your SMTP server is smtp.mydomain.com and your "Default sender address"
   is calendar@someotherdomain.com, some mail systems may bounce the mail back.</li>
       <li>For a Notification, make sure you have the type of Notification
           set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
       <li>For a Reminder:
    <ul>
            <li>Make sure you have "Event reminders" set to "Yes" in the user's Preferences.</li>
     <li>Make sure you have <a href="#reminders">setup a cron job</a> to periodically
      run the <tt>send_reminders.php</tt> script.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
 <dt>Some of the pages are displaying text in English rather than &lt;insert your language here></dt>
  <dd>The translations have been submitted at various points of WebCalendar development.
   Some have not been updated to include newer features.</dd>
 <dt>The text that I entered in the <a href="#siteextras">Custom Event Fields</a> is not being translated
  to different languages.</dt>
  <dd>You will need to add an entry in each of the translation files for any text you add
   into the Custom Event Fields.</dd>
 <dt>How do I get the most recent version of WebCalendar?</dt>
  <dd>You can download the latest public release from SourceForge's
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3870">file list for WebCalendar</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>.
  <br />
    You can download the latest development code from the CVS server using
  the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3870">instructions provided by SourceForge</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=3870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>. (You will need a CVS client to do this.)</dd>
 <dt>How do I install a patch file listed on SourceForge's
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870">list of WebCalendar patches</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker?group_id=3870&amp;atid=303870" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a>?</dt>
  <dd>Most patches are distributed as context diffs. That means they were produced using the UNIX <tt>diff</tt> command with the <tt>-C</tt> option. The patches are intended to be used with the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/patch/patch.html">GNU patch</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/patch/patch.html" title="Open in new window" target="_new"><img src="newwin.gif" alt="new" class="newwin" /></a> program.

Mac OS X will have the patch program installed if they install the developer tools CD.</dd>
 <dt>I forgot/lost my admin password. How can I reset it?</dt>
  <dd>The easiest way is to admin a new admin user and then use that
    new user to reset the password for your old admin account.
    Assuming you have deleted the original 'admin' login, you can use
    the following SQL to insert a new admin user into the database:
    <pre>INSERT INTO webcal_user ( cal_login, cal_passwd, cal_lastname,
cal_firstname, cal_is_admin ) VALUES
( 'admin', '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3', 'Administrator',
'Default', 'Y' );</pre>
    This will add a user with login 'admin' and password 'admin' to the database.
    If you still have a user named 'admin', then replace 'admin' in the above
    SQL with a different username.
  </dd>
 <dt>I get a database error indicating table <tt>webcal_config</tt> does not exist.</dt>
  <dd>This is the first table that WebCalendar tries to access, so it
   typically means one of the following:
   <ul>
    <li>You have not created the database tables as described in the instructions</li>
    <li>You have the wrong database name specified in your
    <tt>includes/settings.php</tt> file</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>I get a database error from MySQL that says "Client does not support authentication protocol."</dt>
  <dd>From the MySQL 5.0 Reference Manual:
  <blockquote>MySQL 5.0 uses an authentication protocol based on a password hashing algorithm that is incompatible with that used by older (pre-4.1) clients. If you upgrade the server from 4.0, attempts to connect to it with an older client may fail with the following message:
  <br /><br />
  Client does not support authentication protocol requested
  by server; consider upgrading MySQL client
  </blockquote>
  The <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html">MySQL
    Reference Manual</a> has solutions for this problem.

 <h2>Appendix A: Using phpMyAdmin</h2>
<p>
If you have <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a>
installed and configured to manage your MySQL database, use the
following steps to setup WebCalendar.
(The following information is based on phpMyAdmin version 2.6.1.)</p>
<ol>
<li>On the initial phpMyAdmin page, under the "MySQL" heading, the first
  option should be "Create new database."  Enter the name you have
  chosen for the database and press the "Create" button.
  (The default database name used by WebCalendar is "intranet".)
  After pressing the "Create" button, it should say:
  "Database &lt;your database name here&gt; has been created." </li>
<li>Click on the home icon (the small house) in the left-side
   navigation. This will bring you back to your phpMyAdmin home page.</li>
<li>(Optional) Create new MySQL user. If you already have
    a MySQL login that you would like to use, you can skip this step.</li>
<li><ul>
  <li>Click on the "Privileges" link under the "MySQL" heading.</li>
  <li>Below any existing users listed, click on the link "Add a new User."</li>
  <li>Fill in the details of your new database user.
      The default username for WebCalendar is "webcalendar"
      with a password of "webcal01".
      Leave the "Host" field set to "Any host".</li>
  <li>From the list of "Global privileges", be sure to select:
      SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FILE, CREATE, ALTER, INDEX, DROP </li>
  <li>Click on the "Go" button.</li>
  <li>You should see a page that says "You have added a new user."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click on the "Databases" tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li>From the list of databases on the page, click on the name
    of the database that you created.</li>
<li>Click on the "SQL" tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, there is an area to upload a SQL file.
    Click on the "Browse" button and select the <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt>
    file in the WebCalendar toplevel directory.
    Then, press the "Go" button.</li>
<li>The top of the page should say "Your SQL-query has been executed
    successfully."</li>
<li>You have now finished creating the WebCalendar database tables.</li>

</ol>

<div class="top"><a href="#" target="_top">↑&nbsp;top</a></div>
<hr />

<a name="appendixB"></a>
 <h2>Appendix B: Database Setup</h2>
 <p>There are three steps in setting up the database:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Creating the database</li>
  <li>Creating the user</li>
  <li>Creating the required tables</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Follow the steps outlined below for the database you are using.
  When complete, a single user account will be created
  with the <strong>login "admin" and password "admin"</strong>, which you are encouraged
  to use to create your own account.</p>
 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> In the examples below, text in <strong>bold</strong>
  represents text that you must type in.</p>
         <p><span class="note">Security:</span> The default values for database, login, and
  password (<strong>intranet</strong>, <strong>webcalendar</strong>, and <strong>webcal01</strong>) are for demonstration purposes only
  and should never be used in a production environment.</p>
 <h3 class="colorheader">MySQL</h3>
 <p>The following will create a database named "intranet".</p>
<pre><strong>mysqladmin create intranet</strong></pre>
 <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.</p>
 <pre><strong>mysql --user=root mysql</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO webcalendar@localhost
IDENTIFIED BY 'webcal01' WITH GRANT OPTION;</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</strong>
mysql&gt; <strong>QUIT</strong></pre>
 <p>If you will be accessing MySQL from a different machine than
  the one running the web server, repeat the command above
  and replace 'localhost' with the hostname of the other machine.</p>
 <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <tt>tables-mysql.sql</tt> file:</p>
 <pre><strong>mysql intranet &lt; tables-mysql.sql</strong></pre>
 <p>In the above example, "intranet" is the name of your database.</p>

 <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you are using
 <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a> to

 <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE TABLESPACE webcalendar
DATAFILE 'webcalendar.dat' SIZE 10M
AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE 40M;</strong></pre>
 <p>Next, create the database user account that will be used to access the database.</p>
 <pre><strong>sqlplus</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>CREATE USER webcalendar IDENTIFIED BY webcal01
DEFAULT TABLESPACE webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>GRANT dba TO webcalendar;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong></pre>
 <p>Create the calendar tables using the supplied <tt>tables-oracle.sql</tt> file:</p>
 <pre><strong>sqlplus webcalendar/webcal01</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>@tables-oracle;</strong>
SQL&gt; <strong>quit</strong></pre>

 <h3 class="colorheader">PostgreSQL</h3>
 <p>The following will create a database named "webcalendar".

<h2>Appendix C: Setting Up Reminders on Windows</h2>

<p>You have two options to choose from when setting up email
   reminders on a Windows platform.
   You can either install a cron package for Windows,
   or you can use the Windows Task Scheduler.</p>

<h3>Installing a Cron Package</h3>
<p>
If you install a cron package for Windows, you will need to setup
to setup a cron job.
(UNIX cron is a tool for used to run tasks as specified times anywhere
from every minute to once a year.)</p>
<p>
First, you should create a <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file
that contains a single line:</p>
<pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre>
<p>You can place this <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file anywhere on your
file system.</p>
<p>Next, you need to setup the cron job.
The crontab entry should look like
the following (replace with the correct path to your
newly created <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file):</p>

<pre>1 * * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre>

<p>The "1 * * * *" will tell the cron schedule to run this task
at 1 after the hour all day long (12:01am, 1:01am, 2:01am, etc.)
If you only want to run it once per day, you could use:</p>
<pre>1 4 * * * C:\your\path\to\sendreminders.bat</pre>
<p>This would tell the cron scheduler to run the task at 4:01am
every day.
For more information about the syntax of cron, check the documentation
for the package you have installed or
view the UNIX man page for crontab
(like <a href="http://www.rt.com/man/crontab.5.html"
  target="_blank">this one</a>).</p>

<p>There are many cron packages for Windows available.
   Below is a list of packages to choose from.
   (Note: use at your own risk. These links are provided
   for information only.)</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cronw.sourceforge.net/"

    target="_blank">jCron</a> (freeware) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the Windows Task Schedule</h3>

<p>Follow the steps listed below to setup a new task
   in the Windows Task Scheduler.
   (These instructions were created with Windows XP Professional.
   Other versions of Windows might be different.)</p>

<ol>

<li>Create a new batch file called <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt>.
    The contents of this file should be a single line:
    <pre>C:\your\path\to\php.exe C:\your\path\to\webcalendar\tools\send_reminders.php</pre>
  </li>

<li>On Windows XP, go to Control Panel</li>
<li>Double-click on "Scheduled Tasks."
  This brings up a window that says "Scheduled Task Wizard" </li>

<li>Click on "Browse..." </li>

<li>Select the location of your newly created
    <tt>sendreminders.bat</tt> file.</li>
<li>Click on "Open" </li>

<li>Change the name of the task. "WebCalendar Reminders" is a good name.
  </li>

<li>Select how often to perform this task. Select "Daily." </li>
<li>Click on "Next" </li>

<li>Select the start time, then click "Next".
    If you are planning on sending out reminders throughout the
    day, pick a time shortly after midnight. </li>

<li> Enter your user password as required. Click on "Next." </li>

<li> Select the checkbox "Open advanced properties". </li>
<li> Click on "Finish." </li>

<li> Under the "Schedule" tab, click on "Advanced." </li>

<li> Click on "Repeat Task" and fill in the details of how often
     the job should run.
     For example, you can set it to run "every 15 minutes", then
     click on "until" and set that time to 11:30pm.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Appendix D: Displaying Upcoming Events on Your Site</h2>

<p>
If you would like to list upcoming events somewhere on a page on your site
(someplace other than the WebCalendar pages),
you can use the <tt>upcoming.php</tt> page to do this.
This page is intended to be included in other pages using the
<tt>iframe</tt> tag.</p>
<p>You may need to modify some of the variables near the top of

      The login of the calendar to display upcoming events for.
      If you want to see upcoming events for user login "joe",
      then you would change this to "joe".
      <br />Default setting: __public__ (The public calendar)
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$allow_user_override</td>
  <td>
      Specifies whether the calendar user can be specified in the URL
      (in which case the $username setting will be ignored) using
      a URL like "upcoming.php?user=joe".
      <br />Default setting: true
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$load_layers</td>
  <td>
      Specifies if the calendar user's layers should also be

<h2>Appendix E: How To Configure for LDAP</h2>

<p>Configuring WebCalendar to use an existing LDAP directory is fairly
simple. It is know to work with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory and
should work with other systems as well.
<br />
<span class="note">Note:</span>
If you use LDAP, the group functionality of WebCalendar does not yet work.</p>

<p>To configure WebCalendar to use LDAP, do the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Configure <tt>settings.php</tt></li>
 <li>Configure <tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt></li>
</ol>

<p>The first step is to set WebCalendar to use LDAP authentication in
<tt>settings.php</tt>. Instructions on to do this can be found in the
<a href="#appsetup">Application Installation</a> section above.
In summary, the following should be set:<br />
<tt>use_http_auth = false</tt><br />
<tt>user_inc = user-ldap.php</tt><br /></p>

<p>The next step is a little more work and involves editing the
<tt>includes/user-ldap.php</tt> file with a text editor. You will have
to set several configuration variables. If you don't know what to set
the variables to, consult your LDAP system administrator. Documentation
exists for all variables in the file. Finally, users have gotten LDAP
working with OpenLDAP and Novell Edirectory by just changing the
following:</p>

<table border="0" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_server</td>
  <td>
      FQDN or IP address of the LDAP server (or localhost).
      <br />ex. 'ldapserver.company.com'
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_base_dn</td>
  <td>
      Specifies the base DN used to search for users
      <br />ex. 'ou=people,dc=company,dc=com' or 'o=context,ou=subcontext'
  </td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">$ldap_admin_group_name</td>
  <td>
      Specifies a group (complete DN) with admin rights for WebCalendar
      <br />You might have to create one in LDAP
      <br />ex. 'cn=it,ou=group,dc=company,dc=com'
  </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>Using SSL with LDAP</h3>
<p>If the LDAP server will accept connections over SSL, simply add 'ldaps://'
to the beginning of <tt>$ldap_server</tt>.<br />Example: ldaps://ldapserver.company.com</p>

<h3>Using TLS with LDAP</h3>
<p>If the LDAP server is set up to use TLS,  set <tt>$ldap_start_tls = true</tt>.</p>

<h3>Using LDAPv3</h3>
<p>If the LDAP server uses protocol version 3,  set
<tt>$set_ldap_version = true</tt>
and <tt>$ldap_version = '3'</tt>.</p>
