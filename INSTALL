REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have PHP and one of the following databases installed:
  - MySQL
  - Oracle 8
  - PostgreSQL
  - ODBC
For the database you choose, you must have its drivers built into
PHP.  For example, to use MySQL, PHP must be compiled with MySQL
support.  See the PHP (www.php.net) for more info on setting up
PHP.

No optional PHP packages (other than MySQL) are required for this
application.  However, PHP shoud be compiled with --enable-track-vars
on some systems.

You can run PHP either as a CGI or an Apache module.  You'll get better
performance with PHP setup as a module.  Not only will you not have to
deal with the CGI performance hit, but you'll be able to use PHP's
database connection pooling.  Additionally, this application can use
a form/cookie-based authentication or traditional HTTP authentication.
For traditional HTTP authentication, PHP must be built as an Apache
module.

If you are planning on using email reminders, you will need to build
PHP as a CGI in order to run the send_reminders.php script.  I would
strongly recommend building a module-based PHP for your web server
and then a second PHP build to create the CGI version.


FILE UNPACKING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpack the calendar software in its own directory somewhere where
your web server will find it.  (See your web server docs for info.)


DATABASE SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
create a new database with the following:
  MySQL (from command line):
	mysqladmin create intranet
	(This will create a database named "intranet".)
  Oracle (from within sqlplus):
	CREATE TABLESPACE webcalendar
	DATAFILE 'webcalendar.dat' SIZE 10M
	AUTOEXTEND ON NEXT 10M MAXSIZE 40M;
  PostgreSQL:
	create database webcalendar;
	\c webcalendar
	\i tables-postgres.sql
	\q

For Oracle, you will want to setup a new user that defaults to
this new tablesapce:
  Oracle (from within sqlplus):
	CREATE USER webcalendar IDENTIFIED BY webcal01
  	DEFAULT TABLESPACE webcalendar;
	GRANT dba TO webcalendar;
	(Note: I use "webcal01" for a password rather than
	"web!calendar" because sqlplus barfs on the "!")

Create the calendar tables using the supplied tables.sql file:
  MySQL (from command line):
	mysql intranet < tables-mysql.sql
	(where "intranet" is the name of your database)
  Oracle (from command line):
	sqlplus webcalendar/webcal01
	@tables-oracle;
  PostgreSQL:
	(This was already done using the PostgreSQL commands
	above.)

This will create all the needed tables and setup one user account
with the login "admin" and password "admin", which you are encouraged
to use to create your own account.


APPLICATION SETUP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Next, you will need to customize the file "includes/config.inc"...

To configure your MySQL access.  Set the values for:
  - $db_type		One of "mysql", "oracle", "postgresql" (untested),
			or "odbc" (untested)
  - $db_host		The hostname that database is running on
			(Use localhost if it's the same machine as
			the web server)
			(This variable is not used with ODBC)
  - $db_login		The database login
  - $db_password	The database password for the above login
  - $db_database	The name of the database that the calendar
			tables reside in.  ("intranet" in the example
			above.)
			For ODBC, this should be the DSN.

You can configure the calendar to run in single-user mode or multi-user mode.
If this is your first time using the calendar, it's easier to try single-user.
You can always switch to multi-user later.  Leave $single_user set to
false (the default) for multi-user or set it to true and set the
value of $single_user_login to set the system to single-user mode.
(And be sure to set the value of $single_user_login to the login that you
would choose if you decide to switch to multi-user mode some day.)

Note: If you do decide to switch from single-user mode to multi-user mode,
make sure you add in a user to the system for the login you set the
$single_user_login variable to.  You will need to do this via the
database (mysql, sqlplus, etc...)  Look in the tables-mysql.sql
(or tables-oracle.sql, etc.) to see the example of adding in the
"admin" user.

Next, you will want to customize the event-specific fields found in
the includes/site_extras.inc field.  You can use this to add extra
fields to your calendar events.  For example, you can add a URL or
a contact email address.  By default, the file is configured with
a single reminder field that allows the user to specify how long
before the event the reminder should be sent.  The
includes/site_extras.inc file is well-documents, so look there for
examples and specific instructions on setting this up.

Keep in mind that if you want to use reminders, you will need to
setup the send_reminders.php script (see below).


SETTING UP EMAIL REMINDERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP does not come with a utility for executing time-based jobs.
So, in order to check periodically for email reminders, a shell
script was written in PHP.  You will need two things to get this working:
- You should have a version of PHP built as a CGI (so that you can run
  php from the command line).  This does not mean you must build all
  of PHP as a CGI.  You can still build PHP as a module for your web
  server and then build the CGI-based PHP later.
- You must setup cron (on Linux/UNIX) or something like cron for Windows
  to run the send_reminders.php script periodically.

Building PHP as a CGI is outside the scope of these instructions.  But,
if you read the PHP instructions, you'll see that the default build
settings will build the CGI-based PHP.  If you really can't do this
(perhaps you don't have permission to install anything new on the
system), skip down a couple of paragraphs to an alternate solution
that does not require PHP/CGI.

For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to the crontab entry of
a user.  (Ideally, this would be the same user that the web server
process runs as, but any user should work.)
  1 * * * * cd /some/directory/webcalendar/tools; ./send_reminders.php

Of course, replace the directory location to wherever the
send_reminders.php file can be found.  It you moved this out of the
tools directory, be sure to update send_reminders.php since it needs
to know where to find the WebCalendar files.  (It is better for
security reasons to move the send_reminders.php file so that it is
not accessible from any URL).

If you cannot setup PHP as a CGI or have no idea how, you can leave
send_reminders.php in its current location and access it via a URL.
IMHO, this is not the best choice, but it still works.  Setup a cron
job to access the URL.  For Linux/UNIX users, add the following line to
the crontab entry of a user.
  1 * * * * wget http://yourserverhere/webcalendardirectoryhere/tools/send_reminders.php > /dev/null

Of course, you should probably test this from the command line first to make
sure you setup is correct.  If you do not have wget installed on your
system, you can use any tool (lynx, perl script, etc.) that is capable
of making an HTTP request for this.

Linux Journal article for instructions on setting them up:

PALM PILOT USERS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not access
Exporting data to your Palm Pilot is possible with install-datebook tool,
which is part of the pilot-link distribution.  You can download pilot-link
from:
	http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2158
Unfortunately, there are some bugs in the install-datebook utility, so you'll
need to patch it before you compile and install pilot-link:
	patch -p0 < install-datebook.patch
Note that install-datebook does not currently support repeating events, so
repeating events will not show up as repeating on your Palm Pilot.  The
tool is not smart enough to know when it's already added an event, so if
you use it twice with the same data, you'll get duplicates in your Palm
Pilot Calendar.


OPTIONAL!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You might want to configure your web server so that users can not access
the "includes" directory.  For example, if a user typed in the URL for the
"includes/config.inc" file, they would be able to see your database login
and password, which is not a good thing.  See your web server documentation
on how to do this.


RUN WITH IT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can place the calendar db tables in an existing database or
Hey, you're done...  Give it a try by logging in using the default
"admin" account (if you're setup for multi-user) or just go to index.php
if you're setup for single-user mode.

FYI, the default password for the "admin" user is "admin".


PROBLEMS
