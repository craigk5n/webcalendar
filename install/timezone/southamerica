# From Paul Eggert (1999-07-07):
# A good source for time zone historical data outside the U.S. is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The International Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1999).
#
# Gwillim Law writes that a good source
# for recent time zone data is the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks is the source for entries through 1990,
# and IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Earlier editions of these tables used the North American style (e.g. ARST and
# ARDT for Argentine Standard and Daylight Time), but the following quote
# suggests that it's better to use European style (e.g. ART and ARST).
#	I suggest the use of _Summer time_ instead of the more cumbersome
#	_daylight-saving time_.  _Summer time_ seems to be in general use
#	in Europe and South America.
#	-- E O Cutler, _New York Times_ (1937-02-14), quoted in
#	H L Mencken, _The American Language: Supplement I_ (1960), p 466
#
# Earlier editions of these tables also used the North American style
# for time zones in Brazil, but this was incorrect, as Brazilians say
# "summer time".  Reinaldo Goulart, a Sao Paulo businessman active in
# the railroad sector, writes (1999-07-06):
#	The subject of time zones is currently a matter of discussion/debate in
#	Brazil.  Let's say that "the Brasilia time" is considered the
#	"official time" because Brasilia is the capital city.
#	The other three time zones are called "Brasilia time "minus one" or
#	"plus one" or "plus two".  As far as I know there is no such
#	name/designation as "Eastern Time" or "Central Time".
# So I invented the following (English-language) abbreviations for now.
# Corrections are welcome!

# From Peter Gradelski via Steffen Thorsen (2000-03-01):
# We just checked with our Sao Paulo office and they say the government of
# Argentina decided not to become one of the countries that go on or off DST.
# So Buenos Aires should be -3 hours from GMT at all times.
#
# From Fabian L. Arce Jofre (2000-04-04):
# The law that claimed DST for Argentina was derogated by President Fernando
# de la Rua on March 2, 2000, because it would make people spend more energy
# in the winter time, rather than less.  The change took effect on March 3.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2001-06-06):
# one of the major newspapers here in Argentina said that the 1999
# Timezone Law (which never was effectively applied) will (would?) be
# in effect.... The article is at
# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-06/e-01701.htm
# ... The Law itself is "Ley No 25155", sanctioned on 1999-08-25, enacted
# 1999-09-17, and published 1999-09-21.  The official publication is at:
# http://www.boletin.jus.gov.ar/BON/Primera/1999/09-Septiembre/21/PDF/BO21-09-99LEG.PDF
# Regretfully, you have to subscribe (and pay) for the on-line version....
#
# (2001-06-12):
# the timezone for Argentina will not change next Sunday.
# Apparently it will do so on Sunday 24th....
# http://ar.clarin.com/diario/2001-06-12/s-03501.htm
#
# (2001-06-25):
# Last Friday (yes, the last working day before the date of the change), the
# Senate annulled the 1999 law that introduced the changes later postponed.
# http://www.clarin.com.ar/diario/2001-06-22/s-03601.htm
# It remains the vote of the Deputies..., but it will be the same....
# This kind of things had always been done this way in Argentina.
# We are still -03:00 all year round in all of the country.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-05-21):
# Today it was officially published that the Province of Mendoza is changing
# its timezone this winter... starting tomorrow night....
# http://www.gobernac.mendoza.gov.ar/boletin/pdf/20040521-27158-normas.pdf
# From Paul Eggert (2004-05-24):
# It's Law No. 7,210.  This change is due to a public power emergency, so for
# now we'll assume it's for this year only.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-01-22):
# <a href="http://www.spicasc.net/horvera.html">
# Hora de verano para la Republica Argentina (2000-10-01)
# </a> says that standard time in Argentina from 1894-10-31
# to 1920-05-01 was -4:16:48.25.  Go with this more-precise value
# over Shanks.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-05):
# These media articles from a major newspaper mostly cover the current state:
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/27/de_604825.asp
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/05/28/de_605203.asp
#
# The following eight (8) provinces pulled clocks back to UTC-04:00 at
# midnight Monday May 31st. (that is, the night between 05/31 and 06/01).
# Apparently, all nine provinces would go back to UTC-03:00 at the same
# time in October 17th.
#
# Catamarca, Chubut, La Rioja, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz,
# Tierra del Fuego, Tucuman.
#
# From Mariano Absatz (2004-06-14):
# ... this weekend, the Province of Tucuman decided it'd go back to UTC-03:00
# yesterday midnight (that is, at 24:00 Saturday 12th), since the people's
# annoyance with the change is much higher than the power savings obtained....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2004-06-14):
# http://www.lanacion.com.ar/04/06/10/de_609078.asp ...
#     "The time change in Tierra del Fuego was a conflicted decision from
#   the start.  The government had decreed that the measure would take
#   effect on June 1, but a normative error forced the new time to begin
#   three days earlier, from a Saturday to a Sunday....
# Our understanding was that the change was originally scheduled to take place
# on June 1 at 00:00 in Chubut, Santa Cruz, Tierra del Fuego (and some other
# provinces).  Sunday was May 30, only two days earlier.  So the article
# contains a contradiction.  I would give more credence to the Saturday/Sunday
# date than the "three days earlier" phrase, and conclude that Tierra del
# Fuego set its clocks back at 2004-05-30 00:00.
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-05):
# The previous law 7210 which changed the province of Mendoza's time zone
# back in May have been modified slightly in a new law 7277, which set the
# new end date to 2004-09-26 (original date was 2004-10-17).
# http://www.gobernac.mendoza.gov.ar/boletin/pdf/20040924-27244-normas.pdf

# From Mariano Absatz (2004-10-05):
# San Juan changed from UTC-03:00 to UTC-04:00 at midnight between

# Brazil

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
# The mayor of Rio recently attempted to change the time zone rules
# just in his city, in order to leave more summer time for the tourist trade.
# The rule change lasted only part of the day;
# the federal government refused to follow the city's rules, and business
# was in a chaos, so the mayor backed down that afternoon.

# From IATA SSIM (1996-02):
# _Only_ the following states in BR1 observe DST: Rio Grande do Sul (RS),
# Santa Catarina (SC), Parana (PR), Sao Paulo (SP), Rio de Janeiro (RJ),
# Espirito Santo (ES), Minas Gerais (MG), Bahia (BA), Goias (GO),
# Distrito Federal (DF), Tocantins (TO), Sergipe [SE] and Alagoas [AL].
# [The last three states are new to this issue of the IATA SSIM.]

# From Gwillim Law (1996-10-07):
# Geography, history (Tocantins was part of Goias until 1989), and other
# sources of time zone information lead me to believe that AL, SE, and TO were
# always in BR1, and so the only change was whether or not they observed DST....
# The earliest issue of the SSIM I have is 2/91.  Each issue from then until
# 9/95 says that DST is observed only in the ten states I quoted from 9/95,
# along with Mato Grosso (MT) and Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), which are in BR2
# (UTC-4)....  The other two time zones given for Brazil are BR3, which is
# UTC-5, no DST, and applies only in the state of Acre (AC); and BR4, which is
# UTC-2, and applies to Fernando de Noronha (formerly FN, but I believe it's
# become part of the state of Pernambuco).  The boundary between BR1 and BR2
# has never been clearly stated.  They've simply been called East and West.
# However, some conclusions can be drawn from another IATA manual: the Airline
# Coding Directory, which lists close to 400 airports in Brazil.  For each
# airport it gives a time zone which is coded to the SSIM.  From that
# information, I'm led to conclude that the states of Amapa (AP), Ceara (CE),
# Maranhao (MA), Paraiba (PR), Pernambuco (PE), Piaui (PI), and Rio Grande do
# Norte (RN), and the eastern part of Para (PA) are all in BR1 without DST.

# From Marcos Tadeu (1998-09-27):
# <a href="http://pcdsh01.on.br/verao1.html">
# Brazilian official page
# </a>

# From Jesper Norgaard (2000-11-03):
# [For an official list of which regions in Brazil use which time zones, see:]
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbr.htm
# http://pcdsh01.on.br/Fusbrhv.htm

# From Celso Doria via David Madeo (2002-10-09):
# The reason for the delay this year has to do with elections in Brazil.
#
# Unlike in the United States, elections in Brazil are 100% computerized and
# the results are known almost immediately.  Yesterday, it was the first
# round of the elections when 115 million Brazilians voted for President,
# Governor, Senators, Federal Deputies, and State Deputies.  Nobody is
# counting (or re-counting) votes anymore and we know there will be a second
# round for the Presidency and also for some Governors.  The 2nd round will
# take place on October 27th.
#
# The reason why the DST will only begin November 3rd is that the thousands
# of electoral machines used cannot have their time changed, and since the
# Constitution says the elections must begin at 8:00 AM and end at 5:00 PM,
# the Government decided to postpone DST, instead of changing the Constitution
# (maybe, for the next elections, it will be possible to change the clock)...

# From Rodrigo Severo (2004-10-04):
# It's just the biannual change made necessary by the much hyped, supposedly
# modern Brazilian eletronic voting machines which, apparently, can't deal
# with a time change between the first and the second rounds of the elections.

# Chile

# From Eduardo Krell (1995-10-19):
# The law says to switch to DST at midnight [24:00] on the second SATURDAY
# of October....  The law is the same for March and October.
# (1998-09-29):
# Because of the drought this year, the government decided to go into
# DST earlier (saturday 9/26 at 24:00). This is a one-time change only ...
# (unless there's another dry season next year, I guess).

# From Julio I. Pacheco Troncoso (1999-03-18):
# Because of the same drought, the government decided to end DST later,
# on April 3, (one-time change).

# From Gwillim Law (2001-05-04):
# I came across another article in "La Tercera" about Chilean DST.
# <http://www.tercera.cl/diario/2000/10/13/t-extras.html>
# It clearly confirms my earlier suggestion, that DST begins at 22:00
# on Easter Island....  But it also seems to be saying that the
# observance of DST in Chile began in 1966, rather than 1969 as
# ... [Shanks] has it....
#
# My translation:
#
# "The Chilean Army has announced that summer time will begin tomorrow,
# Saturday, October 14 in continental Chile, insular Chile, and
# Antarctica, as provided by Supreme Decree 25 of January 11, 1966.
# By the preceding, official time in continental Chile and Chilean
# Antarctic, and official time in Western Insular Chile, which applies
# to Easter Island and Sala y Gomez Island, will be set forward at
# midnight and at 22:00, respectively, by 20 minutes."

# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-04):
# Go with this article in preference to Shanks's 1969 date for modern DST.
# Assume this rule has been used since DST was introduced in the islands.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-24):
# <http://www.shoa.cl/shoa/faqhoraoficial.htm> gives many details that
# disagree with the following table, but we haven't had time to compare them.

# From Falkland Islands Government Office, London (2001-01-22)
# via Jesper Norgaard:
# ... the clocks revert back to Local Mean Time at 2 am on Sunday 15
# April 2001 and advance one hour to summer time at 2 am on Sunday 2
# September.  It is anticipated that the clocks will revert back at 2
# am on Sunday 21 April 2002 and advance to summer time at 2 am on
# Sunday 1 September.

# From Rives McDow (2001-02-13):
#
# I have communicated several times with people there, and the last
# time I had communications that was helpful was in 1998.  Here is
# what was said then:
#
# "The general rule was that Stanley used daylight saving and the Camp
# did not. However for various reasons many people in the Camp have
# started to use daylight saving (known locally as 'Stanley Time')
# There is no rule as to who uses daylight saving - it is a matter of
# personal choice and so it is impossible to draw a map showing who
# uses it and who does not. Any list would be out of date as soon as
# it was produced. This year daylight saving ended on April 18/19th
# and started again on September 12/13th.  I do not know what the rule
# is, but can find out if you like.  We do not change at the same time
# as UK or Chile."
#
# I did have in my notes that the rule was "Second Saturday in Sep at
# 0:00 until third Saturday in Apr at 0:00".  I think that this does
# not agree in some cases with Shanks; is this true?
#
# Also, there is no mention in the list that some areas in the
# Falklands do not use DST.  I have found in my communications there
# that these areas are on the western half of East Falkland and all of
# West Falkland.  Stanley is the only place that consistently observes
# DST.  Again, as in other places in the world, the farmers don't like
# it.  West Falkland is almost entirely sheep farmers.
#
# I know one lady there that keeps a list of which farm keeps DST and
# which doesn't each year.  She runs a shop in Stanley, and says that
# the list changes each year.  She uses it to communicate to her
# customers, catching them when they are home for lunch or dinner.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-05):
# For now, we'll just record the time in Stanley, since we have no
# better info.
