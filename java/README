WebCalendar Web Services - version 0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What this package contains:
- Propietary Web Services written in PHP (that are not SOAP or
  XML-RPC)
  + login.php
  + get_reminders.php
  + get_events.php
  + more to come soon... ?
- A Java library for accessing WebCalendar functions via a proprietary
  Web Services API.  You can use this library to access WebCalendar
  functions from within any Java application (including a servlet
  or JSP)
- The javadoc API for using the library
- Swing-based applications:
  + SampleApp: displays events (read-only) for a week or day, allows user to
    navigate next/previous.
  + ReminderApp: displays reminders in a popup at the appropriate time
  + more to come soon.... ?

Java 1.4 is required since the org.w3c.dom package is used to parse
XML (which is new in Java 1.4).

The XML that is returned from the WebCalendar server is not SOAP.
It is just XML.  This may change in the future if additional functions are
added.  Until then SOAP is probably overkill and would require users to install
additional software (like the PEAR SOAP module) on their WebCalendar
server.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			NOTES ON THE SAMPLE APP

SampleApp is intended to illustrate how to develop a WebCalendar client.
The app could be modified with a much improved UI.

This application may evolve into more than just a sample, I'm on the lookout
for an existing java-based calendar app where I could just replace/extend
the methods that get/update event data.  No need to rewrite a
complete UI if there is one out there already.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			NOTES ON THE REMINDER APP

This ReminderApp client works independently from the email reminders that the
WebCalendar server sends out.  If you wish to use this instead of
the email reminders, you can turn off them in your WebCalendar
preferences.  If you do, be aware that you may miss a reminder if
this app is not running.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				INSTALLATION

The .php files should be installed in a "ws" subdirectory of your
main WebCalendar directory on the server.  If you obtained your WebCalendar
code from CVS, then it is already there.

Users should install the webcalendar.jar file locally and run it as
follows (for the ReminderApp, for SampleApp, just replace "ReminderApp"
with "SampleApp"):

[for web-based authentication]
  java -classpath webcalendar.jar us.k5n.webcalendar.ui.ReminderApp \
    -url=http://yourwebcalurlhere/ \
    -user=UUU -password=PPP
  [where "UUU" is the your username and "PPP" is your password]

[for http-based authentication]
  java -classpath webcalendar.jar us.k5n.webcalendar.ui.ReminderApp \
    -url=http://yourwebcalurlhere/ \
    -httpuser=UUU -httppasswd=PPP
  [where "UUU" is the your username and "PPP" is your password]

Note that you can use both web-based and HTTP-based authentication if
your site is configured to do that.  (The WebCalendar username will be
based on the -user argument.)

The license for this code is the same GPL license used by WebCalendar.
